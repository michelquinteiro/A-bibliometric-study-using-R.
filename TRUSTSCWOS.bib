Abstract = {{This paper examines the Romanian consumers' knowledge regarding food
   hazards and their awareness on certified labelled food, while
   identifying the sources of information they trust. The study reveals
   that half of the consumers are not aware of hazards as mycotoxins and
   pathogenic microorganisms like Listeria, Campylobacter, Yersinia and
   Clostridium, while they perceive food additives and GMOs as being
   hazardous. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal
   component analysis (PCA), it was found that certified labelled food
   provides the consumer with a general feeling of trust; however,
   consumers do not discriminate what the certification is standing for.
   Also, science books are recognized as trustful sources of information
   but family and media are the first option at hand for making an opinion
   on what can put somebody at risk. Applying confirmatory factor analysis
   (CFA) modelling it was possible to link consumers' knowledge and
   awareness with their trust and to identify means to communicate in order
   to fill the existing knowledge gaps and alleviate part of their food
   related anxieties. Suggestions on how to manage this process are given
   with the aim to make Romanian consumers understand the efforts of food
   chain participants to ensure food safety, to avoid confusion on what is
   risky and what is not, and to determine them to share responsibilities
   on food safety. The study may inspire strategies for consumer education
   based on adopting a risk-based approach to food safety not only in
   Romania, but in other countries too, as similarities may exist.}},

Title = {{Assessing differences in levels of food trust between European countries}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{120}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: As the globalisation of the food market continues,
   consumer trust in the food supply chain and the related actors are vital
   for the functioning of the food industry. While past research has
   primarily focused on consumer trust within countries and how it can be
   increased, studies on cross country differences and the comparison
   between trust and distrust are limited to review articles. To address
   this gap, this study investigates the levels of trust and distrust in
   food products and organisations across four European countries (Finland,
   Germany, Greece and the UK).
   Methods: Using a previously validated consumer Trust Toolkit (Benson et
   al., 2020), an online cross-sectional survey explored consumer's trust
   in food and in food supply chain actors. In addition to this toolkit
   measuring trust and distrust constructs, the questionnaire for the
   current study also included relevant sociodemographic, household, and
   psychological items. The data was analysed using ANOVAs, descriptive
   statistics and regressions using SPSS v26.
   Results: Overall, consumers (n = 1027) had a high level of trust in an
   EU food product (beef burgers; mean = 3.981; SD = 1.353) and the
   organisations involved in creating and certifying the product
   (organisations; mean = 4.263 SD = 1.129, food chain; mean = 4.434, SD =
   1.177). The data found that Finnish and UK consumers had the highest
   levels of trust overall, while German and Greek consumers had lower
   trust in their food and foodrelated organisations. Interestingly,
   Finnish consumers reported the highest levels of distrust in
   food-related organisations, which indicates that food-related distrust
   is more nuanced than simply being the opposite of food-related trust.
   These findings are discussed in relation to the cultural context of each
   country and risk practises.
   Conclusions: The levels of food trust and distrust differs across
   countries highlighting the need for developing different business and
   organisational strategies to market products in different
   countries/cultures. Understanding consumers' trust in food and in
   food-related organisations is the first step in benchmarking and
   improving consumer trust across Europe.}},

Title = {{Does importance influence confidence in organic food attributes?}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{87}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have established that consumers have a significantly
   higher willingness to pay (WTP) for organic foods over their
   conventional counterparts. Not fully understood is how consumers view
   the importance of the required attributes of organic, how confident they
   are that the organic label reflects these attributes, and how these two
   factors interact and influence WTP. This study used non-hypothetical
   auction experiments to examine these issues with a sample of 128
   consumers from the general population. Participants first entered their
   WTP for conventional and organic versions of four different foods
   selected in different categories (dairy, meat, vegetable) to cover the
   different possible organic attributes. They were then asked to rate
   their importance level in, and confidence of, seven required attributes
   of USDA organic (e.g. no synthetic pesticides, non-GM). The specific
   goals were to examine the relationship between importance and confidence
   ratings, and to determine if confidence ratings can be predicted by
   importance and how confidence in turn influences WTP. For the former,
   importance ratings for all organic attributes were found to be
   significantly higher than corresponding confidence ratings. Results from
   a simultaneous equation system then showed that higher importance
   ratings significantly increased confidence ratings, while higher
   confidence increased marginal WTP for all four organic food products.
   These findings suggest WTP for organic foods is more complex than
   typically perceived, with it relying heavily on how important consumers
   see each attribute and their confidence that they are really getting
   those attributes with their purchases.}},

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{87}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Generating consumer acceptance for incrementally new food products
   remains a challenge. Drawing on analogical learning theory, we explore
   the combined effect of providing information about the new product's
   closest referent ('the product is like...') and the instrumental value
   of store's frontline employees (FLEs) as credible source of this
   information on a new food product's acceptance. Using the context of
   aquaculture, two consecutive experimental studies with a joint data
   collection have been conducted among UK consumers. Study 1 focuses on
   the adoption of fillets of an unfamiliar fish species with the FLE
   communicating newness, or newness including closest referent
   information. Results confirm that information provided by the FLE has a
   positive effect on consumer attitude and willingness to buy the new
   product, but a similar rather than stronger effect is found for the
   condition including closest referent information. Using a subsample of
   the data of Study 1, Study 2 explores the underlying learning mechanisms
   involved. The findings show that the influence of the FLE's information
   on the consumer's attitude towards the new product is positively
   mediated by the consumer's attitude towards FLE's advice. Additionally,
   the positive indirect effect of the FLE's information regarding closest
   referent on willingness to buy is conditional on the consumer's
   (dis)liking of the referent product and his/her need to taste the new
   product first. These findings confirm that offering information on
   closest referent by FLEs is powerful and can be a useful variable in
   consumer segmentation.}},

Title = {{Examining trust in consumers as new food co-creators: Does the
   communicator matter?}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{86}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Consumers increasingly fulfil the role of co-creators by collaborating
   with producers in new product development. Communicating that the
   product has been co-developed with consumers tends to positively
   influence consumer perceptions. However, research remains limited
   regarding who should communicate this information, particularly in the
   case of food products where consumer perceptions largely depend on the
   trust in the producer and product information. This paper examines the
   influence of co-creation information communicated by a company vs. by
   co-creators (i.e. co-creating consumers) on two dimensions of trust in
   consumers acting as new food co-creators: perceived honesty and
   perceived competence. Furthermore, it investigates how this effect is
   moderated by respondents' familiarity with co-creation as an innovation
   process. Respondents were presented with the same new food product
   concept in an online experimental survey with consumers (n = 697)
   divided into three experimental groups. One group served as the control
   group with no co-creation information provided. The other two groups
   were informed that the product was the result of a co-creation activity
   between the company and consumers, using two types of information
   communicator. In one group, the company communicated the information,
   whereas in the other group, it was communicated by the co-creators. Our
   findings suggest that who communicates the co-creation information
   matters if consumers are not familiar with cocreation. In this case,
   co-creators are more likely to facilitate general consumer trust in peer
   consumers as new food co-creators. This study provides valuable insights
   for food companies wanting to leverage the value of cocreation for
   innovation by selecting the information communicator depending on the
   level of co-creation familiarity in the target market.}},

Title = {{Investigating the antecedents of e-commerce satisfaction in social
   commerce context}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Social media is still influencing consumers and is extending
   social commerce (S-Commerce) use. Different social media activities can
   influence the users' trust and e-satisfaction at different levels, which
   in turn influence the purchase intentions. This is evident for the food
   and beverage industry as S-Commerce mediated by social media can help
   realise a shorter time to market and meet buyer demands. In addition,
   credibility factors may influence trust and purchase intentions.
   Understanding the various factors of influence such as social
   constructs, namely ratings, reviews and referrals; design constructs
   such as credibility and features and behavioural constructs such as
   trust, satisfaction and motivation; and analysing the relationship
   between these factors and how they influence purchase intentions can
   provide deeper insights into S-Commerce research, decision-making
   process and purchase intentions particularly from a food and beverage
   context. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on trust through social
   media activities and surface credibility as well as e-commerce
   satisfaction, the authors have proposed a research model to investigate
   the purchase intention of consumers in S-Commerce platforms. Survey data
   were collected from six countries in Asia and analysed using SEM-PLS.
   Findings Results indicated that both trust and surface credibility
   significantly influence e-commerce satisfaction leading to purchase
   intention. Furthermore, surface credibility, which is a novel predictor
   for purchase intention in S-Commerce context, is highly significant on
   e-commerce satisfaction. Besides, encouraged by surface credibility, it
   was identified that trust significantly affects e-commerce satisfaction
   and results in purchase intention. This research adds contribution to
   theory and practice in S-Commerce stream as discussed at the end of the
   paper. Originality/value The results of this research contribute to the
   S-Commerce literature and have practical implications for practitioners
   in the food and beverage industry. As such, focussing on these
   constructs, this paper analyses the relationship between the social
   media activities, trust, e-commerce satisfaction, surface credibility
   and intention to buy.}},

Pages = {{10273-10282}},

Abstract = {{Similar to the situation in many countries, the dairy industry in Canada
   is challenged by the need to adapt to changing societal demands. An
   industry-led initiative (Dairy Farmers of Canada's proAction Initative,
   known as proAction) was developed to respond to this challenge,
   providing mandatory national standards for on-farm practices. Farmers
   are more likely to follow such standards if they are aligned with their
   values and beliefs. The aim of this study was to better understand
   farmers' perspectives on the future of the Canadian dairy industry, with
   a focus on the role of mandatory policies such as those related to
   proAction. Seven focus groups were conducted, with discussions based on
   the principles of appreciative inquiry. Participants were each asked to
   write down key words that represent the ``must-haves{''} on dairy farms
   in 20 yr from now. Although participants were encouraged to focus on
   aspects directly related to animal care, all answers were accepted. Key
   words were then used to facilitate a discussion and elicit ideas on how
   to achieve these must-haves. Particular focus was on the direction that
   participants believed policy should take to meet these goals.
   Explorative qualitative analysis was used for the written key words, and
   transcripts of the audio- recorded focus group discussions were analyzed
   using thematic analysis. Examples of farm-specific considerations that
   were raised as future must-haves of animal care on dairy farms included
   cow comfort, employee management, responsible health management, and use
   of advanced thechnologies. Participants agreed that objectives can only
   be achieved through collaboration among farmers and between farmers and
   researchers, and they regarded citizen education as a promising approach
   to align differing expectations of the public and farmers. Citizen trust
   in the dairy industry was considered a must-have, and participants
   believed that one of the benefits of mandatory policies for animal care
   is their potential to increase trust. These results may help guide the
   development of new animal care policies and increase understanding of
   the perceived legitimacy of new policies by dairy farmers.}},

Title = {{Validation of novel food safety climate components and assessment of

Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Important insight into the Central and Eastern European food industry,
   beyond traditional food safety (FS) management and reflects on its food
   safety climate or the human route of its food safety culture is
   provided. Novel FS climate self-assessment tool was developed and
   validated by 65 FS experts from governmental agencies, third party
   certification bodies, food sector associations, universities and food
   industry. Three original FS climate components: FS knowledge, business
   priorities and FS legislation, were introduced and their nine components
   were assessed in nine Central and Eastern European countries involving
   470 food companies. FS knowledge was better assessed in big and medium
   sized than in small companies. Knowledge component was equally assessed
   as good, irrespective of the FS risk profile of the food company
   surveyed while certified FS management system was charted by higher FS
   knowledge scores within a same food company. Business priorities in
   Central and Eastern European food organizations were related to hygiene
   and food safety and were always put before profit regardless of the
   company size. Hygiene and food safety were seen equality as a critical
   business success factor irrespective of the associated level of
   riskiness. FS climate legislation component in all food organizations
   surveyed was assessed affirmatively. Central and Eastern European food
   companies seemed to avoid problems in cooperation and trust between food
   safety leaders and other employees, since they have perceived FS climate
   highly and similarly. EU operating food companies had comparable overall
   FS climate to non-EU companies mostly because they have equally
   perceived their business priorities and appropriateness of associated FS
   legislation. The only exception was the FS knowledge that was better
   assessed in EU than non-EU food enterprises.}},

Title = {{Analyzing repurchase behavior and benchmarking brands: implications for
   salespersons in a personal selling context}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This work reports on a study to measure tractor owners' (mostly
   farmers') repurchase behavior (RPB). While earlier studies have focused
   on the technical aspects of the tractors, none as yet have considered
   farmer intention and behavior for predicting purchase decision. A
   conceptual model was built considering all possible antecedents of
   farmers' RPB based on in-depth interviews and discussions with marketing
   managers. Interviews with customers were used to understand these
   antecedents or interactions with salespersons, either directly or
   indirectly during conversations or visits to stores. The authors have
   attempted to develop a scale on farmers' consumption experience from the
   perspective of farmers. Design/methodology/approach The model was
   validated using Smart-PLS, and the best tractor brand was identified
   using data envelopment analysis (DEA). At the village level, snowball
   sampling was adopted to identify potential tractor owners who had
   repurchased the same brand or a higher model as respondents. Findings
   Findings reveal that all the paths were found to be significant.
   Farmers' consumption experience (FE) seems to be the biggest predictor
   of RPB, followed by image, satisfaction and trust. The newly introduced
   construct FE has a significant effect on farmers' RPB. DEA results
   further indicate that most tractor companies function with 100\%
   efficiency. Research limitations/implications The study was carried out
   in India; it can be extended to other countries. Also, the sample was
   collected from one state in India and is cross-sectional in nature, so
   it cannot be generalized. Originality/value First, the authors developed
   a conceptual model considering all possible antecedents of RPB. No
   studies had yet developed a scale on FE. Second, the authors created a
   benchmark for the various preferred tractor brands from the farmers'
   perspective using DEA.}},

Title = {{The importance of trust for electronic commerce satisfaction: an
   entrepreneurial perspective}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Social commerce has seen a prosperous growth following the rise
   of social media, in particular, social networking sites have established
   novel ways to communicate and transact between firms and people. The
   rise of new technologies has also directed to changes in how
   entrepreneurs convey their business. Despite intensive social commerce
   research, the challenges of social commerce for entrepreneurs have
   attracted less attention and especially neglected the role of trust and
   satisfaction in electronic commerce. Design/methodology/approach This
   research use a survey to collect data. The authors use structural
   equation modeling-partial least square (SEM-PLS) to analysis the data.
   This quantitative research provides new insights in the food industry.
   Findings This research thus provides insights into social commerce by
   analyzing the role of trust in the relationship between customers'
   social media activities and customers' satisfaction. The present study
   finds a mediating effect of trust in developing satisfaction. Social
   media activities facilitate a positive level of trust that in turn
   creates a satisfying environment for customers in social commerce. The
   research provides theoretical and practical implications at the end of
   the study. Originality/value The findings provide good knowledge for the
   food industry to stay connected with customers and develop their
   satisfaction.}},

Title = {{Filling the trust gap of food safety in food trade between the EU and
   China: An interconnected conceptual traceability framework based on
   blockchain}},
Journal = {{FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY}},
Abstract = {{Global food trade has become an increasingly crucial element for feeding
   the world's population. Enhancing bilateral or multilateral trust in
   food safety in international food trade is not only important for
   promoting the sustainable development of trade but is also beneficial
   for cooperation when facing a global food crisis. However, highly
   credible traceability systems (TSs) for the cross-border movement of
   food are still absent in many countries and regions. Blockchain is
   regarded as a promising technology that can help build trust for
   transparency and security issues. In this paper, an interconnected
   conceptual traceability framework based on blockchain is proposed in
   order to increase trust in food safety during food trade. Taking the
   food trade between China and the European Union as an example, a
   conceptual framework is designed in order to take full advantage of
   existing TSs in these two locations, and the features of logistical
   flow, data flow, and blockchain flow are analyzed. Considering the data
   capacity and data privacy level, a hybrid data storage method combining
   on-chain and off-chain is adopted. Smart contracts according to the
   features of cross-border food trade-including the recording of
   exportation data, exporter inspection data, shipment data, importer
   inspection data, importation data, and tracing queries-are packaged and
   deployed to a blockchain network. An effective operation mechanism
   involving the distribution of related rights for different roles is
   presented. The blockchain-based TS framework has the advantages of
   enhancing bilateral trust in cross-border food trade, providing a
   flexible and intelligent technical framework, and having effective
   operability. Future challenges, such as data security, special smart
   contracts, and consensus mechanisms, and interoperability with other
   systems, are discussed.}},

Pages = {{779-785}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is no human activity that is risk free, including those most
   trivial and essential for survival, such as eating. Various factors
   impact the risk perception of a population, such as whether the risk is
   voluntary, known, brings some benefits or whether the information about
   the risk is provided by sources seen as trusted. Furthermore, regional
   and cultural aspects, gender and age can also have an impact on risk
   perception, and the level of scientific knowledge of the individual
   about the risks has in many cases little impact on the risk perception.
   In most countries, the perception of consumers to certain risks present
   in food, including genetically modified organisms (GMO), pesticides and
   food additives is high, probably due to the lack of confidence on the
   industry and governmental authorities that are responsible to control
   the risks. Food that are considered more natural, such as organic food
   and ``GMO free{''}, are normally perceived as less risky/more healthy.
   Knowing the perception of the population regarding the risks present in
   food is essential to design clear and transparent risk communication
   strategies, which should consider, in addition to scientific
   information, the subjective aspects that affects the risk perception.}},

Title = {{Consumers' acceptance of an online tool with personalized health
   risk-benefit communication about seafood consumption}},
Journal = {{FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{144}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The importance of seafood for a healthy diet is widely recognized but
   concerns are raised over the risks associated with contaminants, causing
   a communication dilemma concerning this nutritional-toxicological
   conflict. Although health benefits outweigh the risks for the general
   population, caution is needed for vulnerable groups. Increased use of
   the internet for health and nutrition information grants new
   opportunities for online tools with tailored information. The
   interactive FishChoice tool, developed within EU-funded ECsafeSEAFOOD
   project, informs consumers on the health benefits and risks linked to
   their seafood consumption pattern. This study assesses the acceptance of
   the FishChoice tool through an online survey in five European countries,
   namely Belgium, Norway, Spain, Portugal and Ireland (n = 703). About two
   thirds of consumers agreed they would use the provided information when
   choosing seafood species, portion size or frequency of consumption.
   Heavy users of seafood had a higher intention to reuse the tool. This
   study provides preliminary evidence that for risk-benefit communication
   about seafood, online tailored tools such as FishChoice are evaluated as
   user-friendly and useful. Similar tools can be used in situations where
   no general recommendations can be made. Further research should
   determine the long term impact of these communication messages and tools
   on consumers' behavior.}},

   respectively. The results of two experiments, conducted in a field and
   an online setting, show that consumers with a fast, rather than slow,
   life-history strategy are more susceptible to scarcity cues, boosting
   choice and actual consumption of healthy foods when these cues are
   associated with the healthy option. Conversely, for slow LHS consumers,
   the evidence suggests that scarcity cues are less influential, and
   instead abundance cues tend to foster healthy choice. Finally, in line
   with the LHS logic, acute food craving mediates the impact of scarcity
   vs. abundance cues for fast, but not slow, strategists, while
   perceptions of socially validated trust in the food source fulfill this
   role for slow, but not fast, strategists.}},

Title = {{The influence of food trucks' service quality on customer satisfaction

Abstract = {{Purpose Service quality has been highlighted as the vital element in
   fulfilling customers' needs, which contributes to the customers'
   evaluation on the services given. As food truck business is increasingly
   popular in Malaysia, it is important for the food trucks' service
   provider to ensure that their service quality meets the standard to
   satisfy the customers in order to build customer loyalty. Therefore, the
   aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between food
   trucks' service quality with customer satisfaction and its impact toward
   customer loyalty. The customer service was measured using service
   quality (SERVQUAL) attributes (tangibles, reliability, responsiveness,
   assurance and empathy). Design/methodology/approach A quantitative study
   was conducted to examine the influence of food trucks' service quality
   on customer satisfaction and its impact toward customer loyalty. A total
   of 100 food truck customers have been randomly selected to answer the
   self-administered questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using
   frequency, descriptive, reliability, Pearson correlation and regression
   analysis. Findings Findings indicated that three out of five attributes
   of service quality have significant relationships toward customer
   satisfaction. They are tangibles (beta = 0.225,p < 0.05), reliability
   (beta = 0.349,p < 0.05) and assurance (beta = 0.311,p < 0.05). Moreover,
   the customer loyalty (beta = 0.643,p < 0.01) has a significant
   relationship with customer satisfaction. Originality/value Service
   quality can be characterized as the discrepancy between customer service
   standards and actual service. When expectations are higher than
   performance, perceived quality is less than acceptable and therefore
   consumer disappointment exists which eventually decreases customer
   loyalty toward a product or services. The study suggested that physical
   image of the food trucks' service like physical facilities, how the
   service being performed and also courtesy and knowledge of the food
   trucks' employees are very important to transfer confidence and trust to
   customers, which then will influence them to be loyal.}},

Title = {{Expectations and everyday opportunities for building trust in the food
   system}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Consumers' trust in food systems is essential to their
   functioning and to consumers' well-being. However, the literature
   exploring how food safety incidents impact consumer trust is
   theoretically underdeveloped. This study explores the relationship
   between consumers' expectations of the food system and its actors
   (regulators, food industry and the media) and how these influence
   trust-related judgements that consumers make during a food safety
   incident. Design/methodology/approach In this study, two groups of
   purposefully sampled Australian participants (n = 15) spent one day
   engaged in qualitative public deliberation to discuss unfolding food
   incident scenarios. Group discussion was audio recorded and transcribed
   for the analysis. Facilitated group discussion included participants'
   expected behaviour in response to the scenario and their perceptions of
   actors' actions described within the scenario, particularly their trust
   responses (an increase, decrease or no change in their trust in the food
   system) and justification for these. Findings The findings of the study
   indicated that food incident features and unique consumer
   characteristics, particularly their expectations of the food system,
   interacted to form each participant's individual trust response to the
   scenario. Consumer expectations were delineated into ``fundamental{''}
   and ``anticipatory{''} expectations. Whether fundamental and
   anticipatory expectations were in alignment was central to the trust
   response. Experiences with the food system and its actors during
   business as usual contributed to forming anticipatory expectations.
   Originality/value To ensure that food incidents do not undermine
   consumer trust in food systems, food system actors must not only
   demonstrate competent management of the incident but also prioritise
   trustworthiness during business as usual to ensure that anticipatory
   expectations held by consumers are positive.}},

Title = {{Online food delivery services and behavioural intention - a test of an
   integrated TAM and TPB framework}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This research leverages an integrated framework that uses the
   technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behaviour
   (TPB) to analyse the main drivers of users' intention to use food
   delivery apps. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   consumer's willingness to adopt online food delivery (OFD) using the
   models' constructs and extend them to consider food choices,
   convenience, trust and the effect of the perceived risks related to the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as contextual factors.
   Design/methodology/approach The study adopts the partial least squares
   approach to structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the data.
   The final sample consists of 425 people in Italy. Findings The authors
   have found that combining the TAM and the TPB provides a valid and
   significant model that can be used to understand OFD users' behavioural
   intentions. Moreover, the results show that subjective norms have a
   stronger effect on behavioural intentions than the personal attitude and
   that trustworthiness and the perception of risks related to COVID-19
   have different effects. Accordingly, the authors derive several
   theoretical and managerial implications from these results.
   Originality/value This research contributes to the current debate on
   consumer behaviour in the OFD context. Only a few studies have
   integrated the TAM and TPB models in this context. This paper sheds
   light on the factors useful in predicting people's choice to buy food
   via OFD. Furthermore, it highlights the key role of some contextual
   factors and subjective norms over more technical ones.}},

Title = {{Effects of Farmers' Facial Expression on Consumers' Responses in Print
   Advertising of Local Food: The Moderating Role of Emotional Intelligence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In the context of ethical consumption, we examine the effects of
   farmers' facial expression in print advertising on consumers' responses
   to local food. Furthermore, we try to verify the moderating role of
   emotional intelligence (EI) on consumers' responses to the advertising
   message strategy. The advertising message strategy that connects farmers
   and consumers is expected to create more favorable responses among
   consumers toward local food and its retailers. This study examines
   consumers' responses (perceived product quality, trust, and a positive
   attitude toward the local food retailer) to three conditions of farmers'
   facial expression in the advertisement (neutral facial expression,
   positive facial expression, and product only, with no portrait) across
   two levels of EI (low and high). We find that farmers' positive facial
   expressions in the advertisements have the greatest positive effects on
   consumers' perceived product quality, trust, and attitude toward the
   local food retailer under a high level of EI. Therefore, individuals
   with a high level of EI were more influenced by facial expressions in
   print advertising, whereas those with a low level of EI were less
   influenced by facial expressions in print advertising, and their
   responses were indifferent to whether the local food farmer had a
   neutral or a positive facial expression in print advertising. Our
   findings suggest that marketing practitioners consider personal
   characteristics such as EI in persuading local food consumers in target
   markets to implement strategies to promote local food purchase and
   consumption.}},

Title = {{Exploratory modelling and ranking of the trust factors of messages about
   organic foods in social networks}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore a model and note the
   ranking of the trust factors of messages about organic food in social
   networks. Design/methodology/approach The research was divided into four
   phases. The first employed the literature review about Trust, Trust of
   products, Trust of organic foods and Trust in the social networks. This
   review was prepared as some hypothesis about the trust of messages about
   organic food in the social network. The second employed a focused
   interview to supplement the mentioned hypothesis to 31 factors that
   affect the trust of messages about organic food in social networks. In
   the third phase, 300 forms were used to collect information from Iranian
   consumers for exploratory factor analysis. Finally, neural networks were
   used to determine the ranking of the mentioned factors. Findings The
   results show 31 factors that affect the trust of messages about organic
   food in social networks. The results of this study showed that Iranian
   and international organic foods producers may be able to spread messages
   of trust about their products in social networks by attending to these
   31 factors. This study also explored a model constructed using EFA that
   showed that six factors have a positive effect on the level of trust of
   messages about organic food in social networks. Practical implications
   This research effectively helps organic food producers to better
   understand the trust factors and ways to improve that trust in
   cyberspace marketing plans and to increase their sales.
   Originality/value For the first time, this research seeks a model for
   the factors affecting consumer trust in organic foods in social
   networks, and in the next step, it ranks these factors with artificial
   neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{China has experienced frequent food safety incidents that have
   undermined consumer trust in the food supply chain. To overcome this
   problem, China requalified the legislative framework and adopted a
   comprehensive food certification system over the years. Here, we
   investigated the influences of food traceability and Chinese
   certifications (QS/SC-food quality safety market access/production
   system, hazard-free, green, and organic) on Chinese consumer trust of
   food safety for different types of products: fish, meat, milk, eggs, and
   rice. Data were collected through face-to-face surveys conducted in
   rural and urban Chinese areas. With a sample of 757 questionnaires, we
   ran a logit model. The results show consumers' uncertainty and
   skepticism of certifications guaranteeing food safety attributes,
   especially for animal-based products. We found that price is used as a
   cue of safety by Chinese consumers. Individuals with higher education
   seem less influenced by certifications and other cues included in the
   analysis. The findings demonstrate that Chinese policy makers should
   implement new strategies to enhance consumer food safety trust, and
   design policies by considering different categories (e.g., vegetables,
   meat, fish, etc.) of food.}},

Title = {{Consumer preferences for upcycled ingredients: A case study with
   biscuits}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{84}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is a growing interest to add value to food industry
   by-products and incorporate them as new ingredients for novel food
   products. However, there is very little knowledge about consumers'
   reactions towards novel food products made with upcycled ingredients.
   This manuscript provides the first critical scientific investigation of
   UK consumers' preferences for novel food products made with upcycled
   ingredients using four attributes: price (0.40 pound/300 g pack or 1.50
   pound/300 g pack), flour ({''}with wheat flour{''} or ``with upcycled
   sunflower{''}), protein ({''}source of protein{''} or no information)
   and Carbon Trust label ({''}with Carbon Trust label{''} or no label).
   Using a hypothetical ranking experiment involving biscuits, results
   showed that consumers prefer biscuits made with conventional (i.e.,
   wheat) flour and tend to reject biscuits made with upcycled sunflower
   flour. Results suggest there is heterogeneity in consumers' valuation,
   with three groups identified: the first group with price sensitive
   consumers and the strongest preferences for low price biscuits, the
   second group with traditionalist consumers and strongest rejection for
   upcycled sunflower-flour, the third group with environmentalist
   consumers and the strongest preference for biscuits with the Carbon
   Trust label. Most consumers had not heard of upcycled ingredients
   before, but they would consider buying foods with upcycled ingredients.
   These findings provide insights into the psychology of consumers'
   preferences, which can be used to most effectively communicate the
   benefits of upcycled ingredients to the public. This will also have
   important implications for future labelling strategies for policy makers
   providing valuable insights to upcycled food products' manufacturers.}},

Title = {{Consumer communication when eating out of home: the role of technology}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Despite growing demand, little product information is available
   when eating out. Information that is provided is often not well
   understood leading to a lack of consumer control and acting as a barrier
   to healthy food choices. The AIDA model which highlights the key stages
   of effective marketing communication (awareness, interest, desire and
   action) is applied. Information provided through technological solutions
   is examined to provide clear guidance on future use.
   Design/methodology/approach Exploratory qualitative methods through four
   focused group discussions allowed consumers views to be probed in-depth
   and key themes to emerge through thematic analysis. Findings In addition
   to the four key elements of the AIDA model, accessibility and relevance
   are found to be key constructs relevant to food information provision.
   Accessibility highlights the need for quick and clear data display,
   while relevance stresses how salient information is key to each
   consumer. Technological solutions may offer the most responsive,
   effective and trusted way to provide enhanced information. Practical
   implications With increasing consumer demand for clear information, a
   competitive advantage can be gained through the provision of
   personalised enhanced dish information when eating out. Findings from
   this study highlight consumers' desire for online (app or website-based)
   platforms. Social implications The provision of enhanced food
   information when eating out has clear public health implications and may
   influence choice leading to a reduction in non-communicable disease.
   Originality/value This study evaluates consumers' perceptions to the
   provision of enhanced food information out of home providing novel
   insights and guidance for both managerial and societal impact.}},

Title = {{Re-visiting traditional trust measurement: using artefactual field
   experiments to measure trust and predict micro-lending decisions}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this work is to experimentally measure trust and
   study its relationship to group loan allocation within a community bank.
   Design/methodology/approach An artefactual field experiment is run to
   capture a measure of trust that mimics aspects of trusting behavior in a
   community bank. The experimental design and empirical setting take into
   account risk and altruism, two known confounders of trust measures.
   Regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between a novel
   measure of trust and the loan amount a borrower receives from their
   rural community bank. Findings The trust measure has a statistically
   significant, positive relationship with loan size. A one standard
   deviation increase in the trust measure corresponds to a 13.3 percent
   increase in the loan amount. Social implications Results of the study
   suggest that, for community banks, trust in a borrower plays a large
   role in screening applicants and therefore determining loan size.
   Several such banks have considered graduating to commercial credit.
   However, given the outsize role of trust in lending decisions, it is not
   clear if commercial lending models - which rely less on social capital -
   will work. Originality/value A new trust game is developed that captures
   relationship-specific measures of directed trust that community bank
   members have towards each borrower. The trust measure is also
   context-specific as play in the game is analogous to how community bank
   members trust some borrowers (more than others) with larger loans. The
   emphasis on relationship- and context-specific trust measures is key to
   interpreting results from artefactual field experiments.}},

Title = {{Chinese consumers' perceptions of food safety cues and maximising the
   effectiveness of food safety communications}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Food safety is an issue of key concern for Chinese consumers.
   This study identifies intrinsic and extrinsic cues on product labels or
   websites that Chinese consumers use to assess a product's perceived
   safety. Design/methodology/approach Five structured focus groups (total
   participantsn = 41) were run in Suzhou China, in Chinese, to gather
   consumers' perceptions towards food safety cues. Findings A total of 18
   safety cues were identified during the focus group discussions.
   Certifications, country of origin, production date and shelf life,
   ingredients and materials and nutritional information were the five
   safety cues consumers perceived to be the most important. The risks
   perceived by consumers differed based on: product category (e.g. meat,
   dairy, cereal); product form (e.g. fresh, chilled, frozen) and degree of
   processing. Interestingly, consumers used different food safety cues to
   assess a packaged product compared to the product shown on a website.
   Research limitations/implications While providing deep qualitative
   insights into perceptions of food safety cues, further studies which
   seek to conduct quantitative work within a wider demographic context are
   encouraged. Practical implications This information will help to provide
   best practice advice for international marketers and government risk
   communicators on how and where to communicate the safety of food
   products so that they can maximise the effectiveness of their messaging
   within the appropriate information channels and thereby ensure that it
   resonates well with Chinese consumers. Originality/value This study
   contributes to the academic knowledge of consumer perceptions of cues
   related to food safety.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates cost-share program attributes that would affect

   farmers' preferences for cost-share programs using five attributes:
   contracting agency, length of contract, annual verification process,
   costs included, and percent of costs covered. Results suggest that
   producers prefer cost-share programs with shorter contract lengths,
   self-monitoring, and administration by agricultural (as opposed to
   environmental) agencies. Our findings suggest the importance of an
   existing trust between the local communities and the contracting
   agencies for higher enrollment rates in cost - share programs. Our
   results can inform policymakers on ways to increase enrollment rates

Abstract = {{Agricultural activities have imposed significant impacts on water
   resources, leading to hypoxic zones and harmful algal blooms all over
   the world. Government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and
   individuals have been making various efforts to reduce this non-point

   examples of performance-based environmental payment programs generally
   have low participation rates. We investigate the effects of
   externalities in farmers' decisions on neighboring farms, incorporating
   both a knowledge spillover effect and a positive environmental outcome
   externality of farmers' best-management practice (BMP) adoption
   decisions. Our focus is on how these effects may influence the outcome
   of performance-based payment programs and how policy makers might
   recognize these effects in the design of cost-effective policies to
   promote program participation and BMP adoption. Rather than imposing an
   assumption of profit-maximization or forward-looking behavior, we allow
   outcomes to emerge from interactions among neighboring farmers. We
   recommend cost-effective policies across communities depending on their
   composition. It is more cost-effective to target communities with fewer
   innovators and/or target the programs towards the least-innovative

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Tricholoma matsutakeis (TM) is the most expensive edible fungi in China.
   Given its price and exclusivity, some dishonest merchants will sell
   adulterated TM by combining it with cheaper fungi in an attempt to earn
   more profits. This fraudulent behavior has broken food laws and violated
   consumer trust. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a rapid,
   accurate, and nondestructive tool to discriminate TM from other edible
   fungi. In this work, a novel detection algorithm combined with
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and functional principal component
   analysis (FPCA) is proposed. Firstly, the raw NIR data were pretreated
   by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) and multiplication
   scatter correction (MSC). Then, FPCA was used to extract valuable
   information from the preprocessed NIR data. Then, a classifier was
   designed by using the least-squares support-vector machine (LS-SVM) to
   distinguish categories of edible fungi. Furthermore, the one-versus-one
   (OVO) strategy was included and the binary LS-SVM was extended to a
   multiclass classifier. The 166 samples of four varieties of fungi were
   used to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed
   method has great capability in near infrared spectra classification, and
   the average accurate of FPCA-LSSVM is 97.3\% which is greater than that
   of PCA-LSSVM (93.5\%).}},

Abstract = {{This investigation provides an important insight into the Central and
   Eastern European food industry, beyond traditional food safety
   management and reflects on its food safety (FS) climate or the human
   route of its FS culture. Investigation was conducted in 10 Central and
   Eastern European countries involving more than 500 food companies.
   Overall FS climate was assessed as good. The availability of
   infrastructure was perceived the same in all countries although
   ``resources{''} was the lowest scored climate component. Uncertainty
   avoiding national cultures had a stronger preference towards written FS
   procedures and instructions. FS climate was better assessed in bigger
   companies because small companies observed weaker availability of
   resources, smaller number of procedures and instructions and reduced
   risk awareness. FS communication and commitment were not affected by
   company size. The share of food companies without FS system was five
   times higher in small compared to big companies. No effect of FS
   management level or riskiness level on FS climate scores was apparent.
   Food companies seemed to avoid problems in cooperation and trust between
   FS leaders and other employees, since they have perceived FS climate
   similarly. The strongest FS climate segmentation in Central and Eastern
   Europe food companies was observed in terms of the EU membership status.
   EU operating food companies managed to develop a very good and
   distinctive FS climate, with better-perceived leadership, communication,
   commitment, resources and risk awareness than non-EU food companies.
   Transitional economic environment of non-EU countries have undesirably
   influenced the organisational and technological support in their

Title = {{Experiential marketing, brand image and brand loyalty: a case study of
   Starbucks}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Due to the internationalization that has occurred during the
   past few decades, the living conditions of people around the island of
   Taiwan have gradually changed, especially their eating habits. Among
   them, the growth of the coffee market has been very significant. To
   date, many studies have been devoted to exploring the application of
   experiential marketing (EM) in a variety of industries. Many
   experimental results have proven that a positive brand image (BI) will
   lead to brand loyalty (BL). In services, the best at the practice of EM
   is Starbucks. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the role of BI in EM
   and BL for Taiwan's most popular brand, Starbucks.
   Design/methodology/approach In the formal test stage, 225 questionnaires
   were given to respondents in Starbucks located in four districts (Da-An,
   Zhong-Zheng, Nei-Hu and Xi-Yin), which have many more stores than the
   other districts in Taipei City. Two hundred valid samples were obtained.
   This study used structural equation modelling (SEM) to validate the
   relationships among EM, BI and BL. Findings The findings show that EM
   cannot directly impact BL as expected, as it needs BI to do so. In other
   words, BI acts a complete mediator in the relationship between EM and
   BL. Practical implications In this study, BI acts a complete mediator.
   This means that if Starbucks expects to improve consumers' loyalty to
   the brand, it only needs to rely on the good overall image of the brand.
   Facing such business style homogeneity, people need some available
   information to help them to execute their following purchase decisions.
   Though Starbucks can bring me to its locations, meaning that Starbucks
   has made its first move in comparison with other competitors, I still
   decide to leave without any impressive image of this brand. Accordingly,
   we can refer to BI as a powerful endorsement of a qualified relationship
   between EM and BL. Originality/value Compared to past studies on
   Taiwan's/Taipei's Starbucks, this paper simultaneously inputs EM, BI and
   BL into the model. Though Starbucks has achieved great EM success, this
   study finds that EM is no longer exclusive to BL, and BI is a powerful
   endorsement of a qualified relationship between EM and BL. For
   Starbucks, it must strengthen consumer perceptions of its BI to create
   customer loyalty.}},

Title = {{Understanding Filipino Rice Farmer Preference Heterogeneity for Varietal
   Trait Improvements: A Latent Class Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{Using an experimental methodology based on investment games, we examine
   whether smallholder rice farmers from Nueva Ecija, Philippines have
   heterogeneous preferences for improvements in 10 rice varietal traits.
   We use a latent class cluster approach to identify different segments of
   rice producing households and their distinct preferences for trait
   improvements. These clusters were characterisedpost hocusing household,
   farm, and marketing characteristics. On average, farmers invested the
   most in rice varietal trait improvements that offered opportunities to
   reduce losses caused by lodging, insects and diseases. We found four
   classes of farmers with distinct preferences for improvements in variety
   traits. The clusters were significantly different in terms of household
   and farm characteristics. These findings can guide breeding research in
   the development of varieties that have the traits farmers identified for
   improvement, and that will address the unique needs of distinct farmer
   segments.}},

Abstract = {{This study quantified the acceptability of smart food packaging
   technologies and determined their associations with sociodemographic,
   attitudinal, and behavioral characteristics of consumers in China. Two
   quantitative surveys were conducted using an intercept method in Beijing
   with one for intelligent food packaging and the other for active food
   packaging. Chi-square tests of independence and contingency tables were
   used to determine the acceptability of smart food packaging and
   significant associations with multiple variables. Smart packaging was
   accepted by 56\% of participants in both surveys. Marital status and
   employment status were associated with the acceptance of active
   packaging, while consumer interactions with current food packaging were
   associated with the acceptance of intelligent packaging. Acceptance of
   both active and intelligent packaging was associated with trust in
   multiple institutions. This study is the first to provide broad
   information about Chinese consumers' acceptance of smart packaging
   technologies for food products. Findings from this research can
   contribute to further detailed consumer studies in product-specific

Abstract = {{This paper examines how the interaction of social trust and
   institutions, such as land administration, affects household economic
   decisions in Viet Nam. Using a panel dataset of rural households from
   2008 to 2014, we show that negative consequences of the duration of land
   administration on agricultural investment have been lower in rural
   households with higher level of trust. Higher-trust households, when
   facing higher barrier from land administration, tend to invest more on
   agricultural land compared to low-trust households where household heads

   from Vietnam}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{94}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural index insurance offers smallholder farmers the potential to
   manage pervasive weather and environmental risks, and smooth income over
   time. Yet despite the potential benefits, take-up of index insurance has
   been largely disappointing. We employ a novel approach to investigate
   the reasons for low demand and we confirm that farmers systematically
   undervalue agricultural index insurance. We find that access to private
   transfers acts as a substitute for insurance demand, while membership of
   a farmer's union helps explain why farmers value index insurance.
   Finally, we find that individual riskiness is positively related to
   willingness to pay for agricultural index insurance and interpret this
   as further evidence that, within the context of basis risk and lack of
   trust in insurers, farmers valuation of agricultural index insurance can
   be better understood through behavioural theories such as ambiguity
   aversion or prospect theory.}},

Abstract = {{Seafood is an important component of the human diet. With depleting fish
   stocks and increasing prices, seafood is prone to fraudulent
   substitution. DNA barcoding has illustrated fraudulent substitution of
   fishes in retail and restaurants. Whether substitution also occurs in
   other steps of the supply chain remains largely unknown. DNA barcoding
   relies on public reference databases for species identification, but
   these can contain incorrect identifications. The creation of a high
   quality genetic reference database for 42 European commercially
   important fishes was initiated containing 145 Cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (COI) and 152 Cytochrome b (cytB) sequences. This database was
   used to identify substitution rates of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and
   common sole (Solea solea) along the fish supply chain in Belgium using
   DNA barcoding. Three out of 132 cod samples were substituted, in
   catering (6\%), import (5\%) and fishmongers (3\%). Seven out of the 41
   processed sole samples were substituted, in wholesale (100\%), food
   services (50\%), retailers (20\%) and catering (8\%). Results show that
   substitution of G. morhua and S. solea is not restricted to restaurants,
   but occurs in other parts of the supply chain, warranting for more
   stringent controls along the supply chain to increase transparency and
   trust among consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors that
   influence farmers' adoption of Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practices
   (VietGAP) in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach A case study design
   was employed. A purposive and snowball sampling strategy was used to
   select 54 participants for semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data
   analysis techniques were applied to analyse the data. Findings This
   study found that the social, cultural and institutional dimensions that
   define the dominant traditional agri-food system determined farmers'
   adoption of VietGAP and this was expressed in: (1) there was a lack of
   concern about food safety amongst value chain (VC) actors, particularly
   consumers and this limited demand for VietGAP-certified vegetables; (2)
   subjective rather than objective measures were used to assess vegetable
   quality by actors throughout the domestic vegetable VC and (3) the
   coordination of this vegetable VC was dominated by informal, trust-based
   relationships between VC actors rather than through formal written
   contracts. Research limitations/implications This study employed a case
   study approach and focussed on a local VC for fresh vegetables. The
   findings of this research may therefore differ to those concerning other
   produce. Practical implications This study highlights that farmers'
   uptake of VietGAP requires changes to the socio-technical regime of the
   traditional agri-food system. Originality/value This research provides a
   systemic view of the determinants of GAP adoption by farmers and
   highlights areas that need to be considered when designing policies to
   enhance the uptake of public GAP programmes and introduce agri-food
   systems in developing countries.}},

Title = {{Farmer preferences in contracting with modern retail in Indonesia: A
   choice experiment}},
Journal = {{AGRIBUSINESS}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the preferences of smallholder farmers for contracting can
   help in making contracts more sustainable. This paper presents the
   results of a choice experiment (CE) among smallholder farmers in
   Indonesia to assess their preferences for accepting contracts with
   modern retail. The CE was based on attributes of actual sales
   transactions in modern retail and traditional retail channels. A total
   of 301 vegetable smallholder farmers participated, consisting of 173
   farmers participating in traditional markets and 128 in modern retail
   markets. A random parameter logit model estimates that, in general,
   smallholders do not prefer contracting with modern retail over spot
   market selling in traditional retail channels. Most contract attributes
   are perceived as negative by smallholders. A willingness-to-accept
   analysis shows that farmers are critical of most contract attributes,
   particularly those related to quality requirements. Producer
   organizations (POs) reduce transaction costs and increase smallholders'
   preference toward contracts. Contract designs that reduce transaction
   cost, mitigate risks for farmers, provide fair prices, and involve POs
   are more likely to attract smallholders to modern retail channels.

Abstract = {{Empirical studies on the effects of governance structures on incentives
   have still received little attention in the wheat value chain research
   of developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   effects of governance structures on actors' incentives in different
   functional nodes of the wheat value chain. This study used personal
   interviews to collect primary data from input suppliers, wheat
   producers, wholesalers, wheat processors and co-operatives. Mixed
   sampling techniques (i.e. random, census and purposive) were applied to
   select sampling units. Descriptive statistics and the ordered logit
   model were used to analyse the data. This paper found that governance
   structures, opportunistic behaviour, asymmetric information and trust
   influence actors' incentives in each functional node of the wheat value
   chain. Specifically, extension services, governance structures, power
   relations and price information have significant and positive effects on
   producers' price incentives. The study provides pioneering evidence of
   the effects of governance structures on incentives in each functional
   node of the value chain. The study adds new knowledge to the existing
   empirical knowledge. The results recommend government to use effective
   policy interventions to reduce opportunistic behaviours and asymmetric

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the vertical relations along the Italian durum
   wheat chain and the factors affecting farmers' behavior in adopting
   contractual agreements. Sale/crop-growing contracts in the durum wheat
   sector are analyzed through a direct survey to a sample of 261 durum
   wheat farmers. The questionnaire collected data on downstream relations
   and contract terms between farmers and processing and/or marketing firms
   along the durum wheat chain. A logit model is used to identify factors
   affecting the likelihood of contract farming between farms and
   processors. One of the main issues emerging is the low frequency of
   written contractual forms between durum wheat farmers and downstream
   operators. In most cases the farmers do not want constraints and reveal
   a lack of trust in contracts. They prefer to sell their product to a
   local downstream operator with whom they have a long-standing and solid
   relationship of trust. Moreover, results of a logistic model show that
   certain farm features, such as turnover and degree of specialization in
   durum wheat production, play an important role in driving the decision
   to adopt written contracts.}},

Title = {{Addressing Chemophobia: Informational versus affect-based approaches}},
Journal = {{FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of two communication strategies
   (informational and affect-based) in reducing chemophobia, the irrational
   fear of chemicals. In an online experiment, participants (N = 448) were
   randomly assigned to one of three groups ({''}control{''},
   ``knowledge{''}, or ``affect{''} group). The following dependent
   variables were assessed: chemophobia, knowledge of basic toxicological
   principles, affect towards chemicals, benefit perception of the use of
   chemicals, and preference for natural substitutes in consumer products.
   The results showed that only the informational approach, which conveys
   knowledge of basic toxicological principles, significantly decreased
   chemophobia and the preference for natural substitutes in consumer
   products. The affect-based approach significantly increased positive
   affect towards chemicals and the benefit perception of their use, but
   did not decrease chemophobia. This suggested that the provision of
   relevant information about basic toxicological principles is a more
   effective strategy than merely addressing laypeople's affect towards
   chemicals to reduce chemophobia. Relevant knowledge could be taught in
   schools or disseminated by toxicologists and scientists who are trusted
   by the public.}},

Title = {{The mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods in Brazil:
   Consumer's knowledge, trust, and risk perception}},
Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{132}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Since 2003, Brazilian-specific legislation has stipulated that foods
   containing more than 1\% of genetically modified (GM) ingredients must
   provide information regarding their origin with an identification symbol
   on its label. The purpose of this study was to verify the knowledge of
   consumers concerning the mandatory labeling of foods containing
   genetically modified ingredients and analyze the possible motivations
   behind the willingness of the consumer to buy these foods in Brazil.
   Research was conducted on 224 consumers of different socioeconomic
   levels from Limeira, Sao Paulo (SP), Brazil. Consumers were asked about
   socio-demographic variables and were assessed for their knowledge of the
   symbol for genetically modified ingredients on food labels. Depending on
   the consumers' answer about the symbol, they would be directed to a
   specific set of assertions. In the end, seventeen assertions were scored
   using a 5-point Likert scale to determine their profile. These
   assertions were categorized into five constructs: social trust, reduced
   price, perceived risk, perceived quality, and willingness to buy. This
   data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling. Most consumers
   (74.6\%) did not recognize the symbol used in the mandatory labeling,
   although a younger age, a concern regarding GM foods, and a high level
   of education increased the chances of recognizing the symbol. Many of
   the consumers who were able to identify the symbol have found the GM
   labeling difficult to interpret. With regard to their willingness to buy
   GM foods, positive effects were observed for reduced price and perceived
   quality, while a negative effect was observed for risk perception. The
   effect of risk perception was moderated by social trust and perceived
   quality. These results indicate that although the Brazilian GM food
   label policy is aligned with similar policies in developed countries, it
   has been implemented without an adequate disclosure. The consumers had a
   high confidence with regards to the science and the government, reducing
   their risk perception. Our findings indicate that in order to improve
   the effectiveness of this food policy, the Brazilian Ministry of Health
   should invest in advertising the labels, targeting the elderly and
   individuals with lower levels of education.}},

Abstract = {{Who consumers trust is crucial for the efficiency and sustainability of
   the market of safe food, especially in transitional economies. This
   paper empirically investigates the role of indicators and cues
   considered by consumers when purchasing safe vegetables. Safe vegetables
   are chosen as the subject of the study as they are typical credence
   goods: it is very hard for consumers to know whether or not the
   vegetables are safe, even after consumption. We employ the rank ordered
   logit model in an analysis on surveyed data. The sources of indicators
   and cues include: labeling, existence of the place of production,
   store's reputation, government certificate, information from friends,
   price, and appearance of the product. After controlling for factors such
   as education, age, income, gender, our results reveal that Vietnamese
   consumers trust supply side indicators the most, followed by government
   certification, while information from friends and others comes last.
   Further, different demographics have different attitudes towards their
   information source of choice. This result can be applied to other
   markets for credence goods with similar properties, such as organic
   vegetables, in transitional economies.}},

Abstract = {{China has experienced a series of high-profile food safety scandals in
   the past few years that seriously challenged public confidence in the
   domestic food industry. Much attention has been paid to Chinese
   government's food regulatory and inspection systems. Scant research,
   however, has been devoted to analyzing Chinese consumers' food safety
   concerns. This study interviewed 2092 Chinese consumers in Beijing,
   Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Jinan, and Harbin and used the Conditional
   Logit model, Mixed Logit model, and the Latent Class model to analyze
   consumer preferences and marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for selected
   food safety attributes of Fuji apple products. We identified three
   consumer segments: certification-oriented (65.9\%), price and
   origin-oriented (19.1\%), and not interested (15.0\%). Results reveal
   that Chinese consumers, in general, are willing to pay a premium for
   selected food safety attributes. Consumers' perceptual and attitudinal
   factors and socio-demographic characteristics are used to determine the
   sources of preference heterogeneity. Marginal analysis is also conducted
   to estimate the response of the model and selectione'd probability to
   potential policy levels, such as increasing the perception of food
   safety and the trust on labeling and traceability information to improve
   the evaluation of food safety.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Studies investigating food safety risk perception (FSRP) have
   substantially increased in recent years, particularly because of recent
   cases of food contamination. Most studies analysed the effects of FSRP
   antecedents and their consequences but reported heterogeneous effects.
   To consolidate these results and provide a more robust and parsimonious
   picture of FSRP, we conducted a meta-analysis of 128 empirical studies
   that investigated the key drivers and outcomes of FRSP and potential
   moderator variables. Our findings reveal the key drivers (trust,
   knowledge, subjective characteristics, and socio-demographic
   characteristics) of FSRP and a robust negative consequent effect on the
   willingness to buy (WTB). Also, we reveal the moderation role of the
   food origin, risk type, healthiness, shelf life and pleasure in the
   consequent effect. Our results contribute to the growing literature
   related to FSRP by consolidating previous results and help establish a
   foundation for further advancement in this topic. More importantly, our
   findings provide a more comprehensive picture of the FSRP phenomenon to
   help in the design of guidelines and rules that shape supplier behaviour
   to enhance food safety along the food supply chain.}},

   Visual images convince only the youngest consumers. The study revealed
   the importance of social perception and trust in the social system for

Abstract = {{Understanding consumers' perceptions toward chicken meat safety and
   quality could provide valuable information to public health educators
   since it is the most consumed meat. This study explores perceptions of a
   group of South African consumers on the safety and quality of chicken
   meat based on intrinsic and extrinsic attributes and identifies related
   safety risks. Data were collected through a web-based survey (863
   participants). A substantial proportion of consumers considered
   supermarkets as the most trusted outlets to sell safe and good quality
   chicken (compared with butcheries, wholesalers, farmers' markets, street
   vendors, or ``other retailers{''}). The majority of respondents (53\%)
   most trusted refrigerated chicken to be of good quality compared with
   36\% trusting frozen chicken or 11\% chicken at room temperature. Frozen
   chicken was considered most safe by 48\% of consumers while 43\%
   regarded refrigerated chicken as most safe. At point of purchase and
   home, smell, use-by date, sell-by date, and color were perceived as
   important attributes when judging chicken safety and quality. Consumers
   considered the absence of brine use and growth-promoting hormones in
   chicken feed as relatively important. The majority of consumers can be
   classified as highly involved during purchasing. It is essential that
   consumers apply safe chicken handling practices from point of purchase
   to consumption, irrespective of the type of retailer, perceived sensory
   characteristics, and date labels to reduce or eliminate microbial risks.
   Addressing consumer's knowledge and expectations regarding factors such
   as growth-promoting hormones and free range may improve safety and
   quality perceptions.
   Practical Application This study gives insight into perceptions of a
   group of South African consumers toward safety and quality of chicken
   meat. Understanding consumers' perceptions can provide valuable
   information to public health educators since chicken meat is a common
   vehicle for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp., which are human
   pathogens. Additionally, this information can assist the chicken
   industry to meet consumer expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose While the essential role of brand trust toward consumer decision
   to purchase food products has been well addressed, there has been still
   little research on its influential factors. The primary purpose of this
   study was to explore factors affecting consumer trust in brands of safe
   vegetables. Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling
   technique was applied to test the hypothetical relationships based on a
   sample of 361 consumers from a face-to-face interview in the urban areas
   of Hanoi city, Vietnam, in March and April 2018. Findings The authors'
   findings show that both brand credibility and brand reputation
   positively affected brand trust. The trustworthiness of a safe vegetable
   system had a more important role than the competence in building brand
   trust. While the effects of system trustworthiness on brand trust were
   found directly and indirectly (through brand credibility), system
   competence only had an indirect influence on brand trust via brand
   reputation. Notably, while risk recall directly reduced brand trust,
   risk information caused a directly positive effect on brand trust. In
   addition, the impact of food hazards on brand trust was indirect through
   brand credibility. Practical implications Based on our results, the
   Vietnamese government and stakeholders in the safe vegetable chain
   should improve brand trust based on fulfilling comprehensive
   traceability, expanding the brand reputation and providing an
   appropriate risk communication strategy to the public. Originality/value
   This study is one of the first attempts to model and evaluate factors
   affecting brand trust in the food sector directly and indirectly.}},

   financial domain: a qualitative review}},
Journal = {{FOOD SECURITY}},
Abstract = {{The Farmer Field School (FFS) is a widely used method seeking to educate
   farmers to adapt agricultural decisions to diverse and variable field
   conditions. Out of 218 screened studies, 65 were selected to review the
   impact of the FFS. An analytical framework was developed with effects
   (outputs, outcomes and impacts) arranged according to the human, social,
   natural and financial domains. Impacts on non-participants of the FFS
   were addressed as peripheral effects. The FFS demonstrated its potential
   to enhance human, social, natural and financial capital of rural
   communities. Human capital was built in the form of critical thinking,
   innovation, confidence, and quality of life. Effects on social capital
   included mutual trust, bonding, collective action, networking, and
   emancipation. Natural capital was enhanced through improvements in field
   practices, food production, agricultural diversification, and food
   security. Financial capital was enhanced through increased income and
   profits, savings and loans schemes, with a potential to reduce poverty.
   The available body of evidence was unbalanced across the capital
   domains, providing high coverage of the natural domain but low coverage
   of the human, social and financial domains. In-depth case studies are
   needed to elucidate the interactions between livelihood assets, and the
   influences of the policy, institutional and external environment, in
   order to adjust FFS interventions aiming to optimize their impacts.
   Considering the positive effects the FFS can have on rural livelihoods,
   the FFS has potential to contribute to achieving the Sustainable
   Development Goals. However, quality assurance of the FFS and a balanced
   evaluation across the capital domains require attention.}},

Abstract = {{We show how policymakers in developing regions can generate richer
   insights from using the choice experiment method best-worst scaling
   (BWS) method when ranking policy priorities on an importance scale. More
   specifically, we adopt BWS to provide an update on constraints that
   limit the participation of Kenyan horticultural smallholder farmers in
   modern agricultural value chains. In addition to traditional constraints
   posed by input market failures and missing institutions, we considered
   constraints such as trust and familiarity with buyers shown by recent
   empirical studies to inform smallholders' market choices. Ascertaining
   the relevance of these constraints highlights our contribution to the
   existing literature. We find that farmers consistently rate access to
   high-quality inputs as their main constraint followed by concerns about
   access to credit, the high cost of meeting food standards, missing
   cooperatives, and exploitative intermediaries. Respondents considered
   insufficient labor, small farmlands, and weak tenure rights as the least
   important constraints. Age, location, gender, household income, and
   education influence the relative importance various segments of
   smallholders place on these constraints. For example, constraints are
   economic rather than personal for low-income farmers.
   Counterintuitively, rural smallholders are less likely to perceive poor
   transportation network as a constraint. Smallholders' distrust of buyers
   they interact with is informed by their location and income. In
   designing intervention initiatives, policies that focus on segments of
   smallholders are needed for improving smallholder participation in
   modern agricultural value chains.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose While literature discussed value cocreation, most still has its
   focus from customer perspective, this study fills up this gap by
   focusing on supplier perspective. Second, prior works discussed the
   outcomes of cocreation; however, the process mechanisms are still
   under-explored, this study thus aims to explore these process mechanisms
   that drive value co-creation in the agro-food industry.
   Design/methodology/approach Case study is used as the method;
   specifically, six in-depth interviews on an agro-food company and its
   suppliers (i.e. farmers) are conducted, and data are analyzed using the
   grounded theory approach. Findings (1). Agro-food company and its rice
   suppliers invest different resource types and resource density, and the
   agro-food company is a main actor, i.e. resource investor and
   integrator; (2). While motivations of the agro-food company and farmers
   are different, they are mutually fit in the sustainability value; (3).
   Both parties share similar process mechanisms, i.e. co-production,
   senses of identification and trust, mutual interaction and information
   sharing and (4). Both parties thus have similar consequences, i.e.
   sustainability, codevelopment. Originality/value This study (1) proposes
   an innovative model of what and how values are cocreated, particularly
   in the agro-food industry; (2). uses three theories, i.e.
   input-process-output (I-P-O) model (McGrath and Kelly, 1986),
   service-dominant logic (SD-L) (Vargo and Lusch, 2004), cocreation design
   framework (Frow et al., 2015), to understand this phenomenon and thus
   demonstrates and enriches these three theories, particularly applied in
   the agro-food contexts; (3).offfers practical suggestions to agro-food
   firms and social enterprises, particularly those having food safety and
   environment issues.}},

Abstract = {{A flavoring agent is a compound that serves to add flavor with a
   pleasant scent and is used as a feed additive. Current flavor analysis
   methods include reflux pretreatment, titration, neutralization
   titration, and inversion; these are all analytical methods in which
   deviations and errors between experiments are generated. Titration
   methods are characterized by difficult selectivity analysis both for
   mixtures containing two or more types of flavoring agents and also for
   very low content samples. Current analysis methods are therefore
   particularly unsuitable for these sample types. Thus, more precise and
   accurate analysis of flavor agents is needed. This study intends to
   develop and verify a multi-component simultaneous analysis method that
   can accurately confirm the guaranteed content of 12 flavor agents of
   supplementary feeds distributed in the market, the goal being to
   establish a universally trusted method. Method validation was performed
   according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and
   International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) guidelines.
   Method validation was performed in terms of linearity, sensitivity,
   selectivity, accuracy, and precision. The limits of detection (LOD) for
   the instrument employed in these experiments ranged from 0.44-4.77
   mg/kg, and the limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 1.32-14.31
   mg/kg. Average recoveries of the 12 flavoring agents ranged from
   75.1-111.4\%. Maximum \%RSD values for intraday and interday peak area
   variation are 13.09\% and 13.08\%, respectively. A novel and simple
   method for detecting 12 flavoring agents in animal feed supplements
   using a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) was
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates how online store atmospherics (i.e., social
   cues) affect consumer purchase intentions of organic wine. A
   between-subject experiment with a quantitative survey conducted among
   German consumers reveals that the mere presence of social cues (i.e., a
   chat box) on a wine sellers' online platform positively affects the
   intention to purchase organic wine from this online store because social
   cues elicit perceptions of social presence that translate into trust in
   the online store and brand trust. The latter promotes purchase
   intentions. Internal (i.e., familiarity with organic wine purchases) and

   moderate the effects of social cues.}},

Abstract = {{Compliance is the act or status of complying with an imperative
   regulatory or normative requirement, that is, compliance means working
   within boundaries defined by contractual, social, or cultural standards.
   The aim of this narrative review is to use the food supply chain as a
   lens of enquiry to distinguish between compliance-based and
   integrity-based organizational climates and frame and rationalize why
   deviant behavior arises and how it can be identified. Contemporary
   theory is explored and critiqued using case studies to contextualize the
   challenge of organizations promoting supply chain compliance and at the
   same time recognizing the need for deviant behavior to occur in order to
   drive innovation and continuous improvement within food supply chains.
   Deviant behavior can be perceived as either positive in terms of driving
   continuous improvement or destructive where this behavior has a negative
   impact on the organization. Although multiple cultural maturity models
   seek to characterize positive food safety culture and climate, there is
   minimal research that focuses on the characterization of deviant
   negative behavior or the development of early warning systems designed
   to pinpoint signals, traits, or characteristics of this behavior such as
   low staff morale, theft, property destruction, or absenteeism. The use
   of cultural maturity models and assessment tools is of value in
   assisting organizations to translate from a rule, instrumental, or
   compliance-based organizational climate to an ethically strong
   organizational climate that focuses on integrity, building trust, and
   values and a new cultural maturity model is proposed and explored.}},

Abstract = {{While previous studies recognise the importance of social capital for
   cooperatives' social and economic outcomes, there are no empirical
   studies on the determinants of farmers' social capital in cooperatives.
   This paper investigates the determinants of social capital using data
   from farmers in dairy cooperatives in Ethiopia. First, principal
   component analyses (PCAs) are performed on the data set of dimensions of
   social capital: structural, relational and cognitive. After applying
   PCA, composite indicators are developed as measures of farmers'
   dimensions of social capital. Second, seemingly unrelated regression is
   employed to identify the determinants of the dimensions of social
   capital. The results suggest that marital status, education level and
   length of membership have a positive effect on the structural dimension.
   The relational dimension has a positive relationship with the ownership
   of a radio, the number of close friends, and membership in associations,
   while training access and number of close friends positively influence
   the cognitive dimension. The study concludes that improving farmers'
   social capital in dairy cooperatives requires investment in the
   educational system, creating and developing local associations,
   promoting cooperatives through mass media, and strengthening the
   existing training programmes.}},

   structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling was performed for both
   organisms, while docking and molecular dynamics were used only for
   Drosophila melanogaster. Neryl acetate has the lowest interaction energy
   (-87 kcal/mol) against active site of acetylcholinesterase, which is
   comparable to the ones of methiocarb and pirimicarb (-90 kcal/mol) and
   reported PDB binder 9-(3-iodobenzylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine
   (-112.67 kcal/mol). Interaction stability was verified by molecular
   dynamics simulations and showed that the stability of ACHE active site
   complexes with three selected terpenes is comparable to the one of the
   pirimicarb and methiocarb. Overall, our results suggest that pulegone,

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact level of six
   factors that condition participation in value chain of lychee growers in
   the Luc Ngan District of Bac Giang Province in Vietnam. This contributes
   to the literature on value chain development through the exploration of
   the case of an agriculturally based primary industry in the global
   south. Specifically, it analyzes the impacts of several factors on the
   participation of lychee fruit farmers in the attributed value chain of
   Bac Giang Province in the north of Vietnam to identify salient points of
   policy intervention. Design/methodology/approach Data for this study
   were collected from a survey of 270 lychee farmers in three districts of
   Bac Giang Province. Six factors, including the trust level of the
   participants, partner capacity, geographical distance between
   participants, collaborative culture, participation strategy and
   existence of specific government policies, were analyzed through a
   Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test, Cronbach's alpha and the exploratory
   factor analysis (EFA) method to evaluate the reliability of the factors
   and suitability of the model. A regression analysis was then used to
   evaluate the impact level of each element on the collaboration of
   farmers in the chain. Findings The results show that each of the six
   factors has significant impacts on farmer participation and the
   resulting chain thickness. Although the findings of this study are drawn
   from the case of lychee farmers in the north of Vietnam, they are argued
   to be transferable to other countries with rapidly growing middle-income
   economies.
   Research limitations/implications - The research conclusions are based
   on only the opinions of surveyed lychee growers in Luc Ngan District,
   Bac Giang Province. Similarly, this paper only explores six factors
   influencing participation in the value chain. Additional factors,
   including age, have not been used in this study and are suggested
   avenues for future research.
   Originality/value The paper suggests that policy makers on the local and
   regional levels in Vietnam reassess their focus and center these six
   factors as precursory conditions to improving local and regional
   economic development. Implications for other peripheral regions with
   agricultural production across the global south are also posited.}},

Abstract = {{Consumers have become increasingly concerned about food safety due to
   numerous food scandals and incidents over the past two decades.
   Consequently, they demand to be informed of the processes involved along
   the food supply chain. Employing a traceability system, tracing food
   from `farm to fork', has been embraced by the food industries and
   governments as an important tool to restore and increase consumers'
   confidence in food safety. However, there is limited research examining
   consumers' perceptions of, and confidence in, the food traceability
   system to fulfil the role of ensuring food safety. To bridge the
   knowledge gap, we conducted an online survey of 489 consumers from three
   major Australian cities. The results suggested that although
   participants had a great desire to know how their food was produced and
   handled, it was their understanding of, and confidence in, food
   traceability systems that strongly predicted their willingness to pay
   (WTP) for having their food traced. Participants also indicated that, in
   comparison to locally produced food products, it was more important to
   have imported food products traced. However, paradoxically, the
   information provided by the traceability system of imported food
   products was less trusted. The results highlight that, in order to use
   the food traceability system to gain consumer trust in food safety, it
   is critical to inform consumers how the system works to build their
   confidence in the system.}},

   in Imported Seafood Applied to Seafood Safety in Australia}},
Journal = {{FOODS}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{It is not suggested that any country is intentionally exporting seafood
   which does not comply with Codex seafood-safety
   guidelines/codes/standards. However, with an open access resource such
   as fisheries, there is vast potential for errors to occur along
   convoluted supply chains, spanning multiple countries, which may
   negatively impact the safety of edible seafood products imported into
   Australia. Australian importation policy and inspection procedures are
   founded upon a bedrock of trust in the integrity, reliability and safety
   of the global seafood supply chain. In order for seafood imported to
   Australia to be considered safe the non-mandatory international health
   standards, governed by Codex Alimentarius, for seafood must be
   predicated upon the most efficacious methods and stringently governed by
   each exporting provenance. Currently, tests for zoonotic parasites are
   not applied to imported edible seafood products on arrival into
   Australia. Therefore, this critical analysis is aimed at discussing the
   effectiveness of current testing protocols for zoonotic parasites in
   edible seafood advised by Codex Alimentarius which may impact the safety
   of the product imported into Australia.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most widely discussed reports addressing sustainable food
   production and healthy diets is Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet
   Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems (EAT-Lancet)
   launched in January 2019. The report is stated to be based on best
   available science but unfortunately the methodology applied is not
   transparent or in alignment with certain scientific standards. The diet
   prescribed by EAT-Lancet is based on health considerations alone, before
   looking at certain environmental aspects, but no description is given as
   to how the very specific intake levels for each food were set. The diet
   is especially restrictive for animal sourced foods, even though
   evidence-based dietary guidelines in many countries have concluded that
   these foods can be part of a health-promoting diet. Furthermore, an
   independent review has found several flaws and weaknesses in the report.
   EAT-Lancet also fails to account for national differences in natural
   opportunities for food production. Implementation of their
   recommendations will make many countries more reliant on imports which
   contrast with the recommendations by the FAO and the IPCC. Taking these
   issues into account warrants caution before taking on trust the
   recommendations by EAT-Lancet into business and policy.}},

   about the openness of food manufacturers, are strongly related to
   consumer confidence. Some national differences in trust and confidence

Title = {{The impact of varying educational intervention on consumer understanding

   strategies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
   different forms of educational intervention (active learning, passive
   learning, and passive learning with an authoritative effect) and the way
   it is presented (soft or aggressive), to improve the knowledge of
   consumers regarding sodium and also sodium-reduced product labels. The
   different educational interventions were used to provide information
   about sodium chloride, its importance in the body, and the label of the
   product with reduced sodium content. The research questionnaire was
   designed to determine the effect of different educational approaches.
   The educational interventions were equally efficient for the participant
   understanding of the questions about sodium and label. For questions,
   which refer to participant behavior and intention to buy, the
   educational intervention, passive learning was slightly (p <= .05)
   better than the others. The aggressive approach proved to be more
   efficient compared to the soft approach as the approach technique for
   educational intervention. The use of shocking information, such as the
   mortality rate, is an important tool to influence consumers to change
   their behavior.
   Practical Applications This research provides unprecedented information
   for the scientific community and the food industry. It expands the
   knowledge about the effectiveness of educational interventions (active
   learning, passive learning, and passive learning with authoritarian
   effect), which plays an effective role in improving consumer
   understanding of the damages caused by excessive sodium intake. The
   results of this can be study used to define media plans in order to
   achieve the consumption and consequently guide the consumer to consume
   less sodium.}},

Title = {{The development and validation of a toolkit to measure consumer trust in
   food}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{110}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Consumer trust is an important aspect in the functioning of any market
   but particularly the food and drinks sector. Food safety incidents and
   changes in food production practices have simultaneously led to a
   decrease in consumer trust and a need for greater trust. Previous
   research has developed items to measure consumer trust in food, however,
   these have not always been subject to validity and reliability testing
   and there exists no collated toolkit or collection of items to measure
   trust in various aspects of the food system. Therefore, the current set
   of studies aimed to develop a valid and reliable consumer trust toolkit
   which can be used to measure trust in specific aspects of the food
   system. Study 1 consisted of a literature review of previous consumer
   trust measures to construct an initial toolkit of items, followed by an
   exploratory factor analysis (n = 481) to identify the structure of the
   toolkit. Study 2 (n = 1,027) used confirmatory factor analysis to verify
   the factor structure of the model from study 1 with six different
   factors (types of trust): Organisation trust, product trust,
   interpersonal trust, trust in the food chain, organisation distrust, and
   general distrust. Study 2 also established the validity of the toolkit
   (face validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity). Study 3
   resampled a collection of individuals from study 2 (n = 247) to
   establish composite reliability and temporal stability (test-retest
   reliability). The resultant consumer trust toolkit provides a valid and
   reliable collection of items which can be used in future research to
   measure consumer trust in selected aspects of the food system.}},

   pure meat samples, all species were correctly identified including
   several exotic species, and close-related species were correctly
   differentiated. Species were successfully detected and identified in
   mixtures down to 1\% (w/w). The reliability of the tool was further
   confirmed on several proficiency test samples, and promising
   quantification data were obtained. Finally, 45 ground meat samples

Title = {{The effects of carrier, benefit, and perceived trust in information
   channel on functional food purchase intention among Chinese consumers}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{81}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The importance of consumers' perceptions and adoption behavior has been
   recognized in the development of functional food innovation, but the
   issues have not been widely explored in China. This study aimed to
   examine the effects of carrier, benefit, and trust in information
   channel about functional foods on purchase intention as well as the
   demographic differences of these effects. A survey with 1144 respondents
   from Mainland China revealed that carriers were more important factors
   than benefits for perceived attractiveness and purchase intention.
   Benefits were more positively evaluated when attached to a more
   attractive carrier. Benefits of improving the body's natural defense
   system were most favored by all groups; benefits about specific diseases
   were suitable to tailor for certain groups. Consumers with low
   educational level were reluctant to functional foods. The improvement of
   consumer education level does not necessarily increase the consumers'
   purchase intention. Given the Chinese acquaintance society and the
   jeopardized public trust in food safety, the interpersonal channel was
   the most trusted information channel. However, perceived trust in mass
   media had more remarkable effects in predicting purchase intention
   toward functional foods, the typical products with credence attributes.
   Trust in mass media negatively interacted with friends' recommendation
   in affecting purchase intention. These findings extend our understanding
   of how to tailor products for different groups and the effects of
   information channels on purchase intention.}},

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{81}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the moderating effects of perceived communication,
   satisfaction and trust on the intention-behaviour gap and the perceived
   behavioural control (PBC)-behaviour gap in the theory of planned
   behaviour (TPB) model, using a quantitative research method. A
   nationwide panel-only online survey was conducted, resulting in 1011
   usable responses from organic food consumers in Australia. Data were
   analysed statistically using SPSS v.25 and SmartPLS 3 software, and the
   hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares-based structural
   equation modelling (PIS-SEM) technique. The findings confirm that
   perceived communication, satisfaction and trust positively and
   significantly enhance purchase behaviour and lessen gaps in the
   intentionbehaviour and PBC-behaviour relationships in the TPB model.
   This study also validates the TPB model and finds statistically
   significant results in support of all of its 14 hypotheses. It is the
   first such study to examine the intervention efficacy or moderating
   effects of perceived communication, satisfaction and trust on the
   intention-behaviour and PBC-behaviour gaps in the TPB model. Examining
   the mediational effect of behavioural intention in the TPB model and
   including the Australian context are among its other contributions.
   Organic food producers and marketers aiming for sustained, positive
   changes in consumer behaviour are encouraged to consider the findings
   and Implications of this study.}},

Abstract = {{While previous studies recognise the importance of trust in
   cooperatives, there are very few empirical studies on the role trust
   plays in market participation in dairy cooperatives. This paper
   investigates the effect of trust on farmers' milk market participation
   using data from dairy cooperatives in Ethiopia. First, a principal
   component analysis was performed on the data set of trust indicators to
   construct a composite indicator for measuring farmers' trust. Second,
   the Heckman two-step procedure was employed to investigate the effect of
   trust on milk market participation. The result from the Tobit model
   indicates that trust is an important factor influencing the intensity of
   milk marketing through the cooperatives. The following implications are
   worthy of consideration for improving farmers' trust and thereby market
   participation: improving the competency of the management, communicating
   and sharing of information, and democratic election of the management.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Wine has been produced for thousands of years and nowadays we
   have seen a spread in the wine culture. E-commerce sales of wine have
   increased considerably and online customer's satisfaction is influenced
   by quality and price. This paper presents a case study of the company
   ``QuieroVinos, S.L.{''}, an online wine shop founded in 2015 that sells
   Spanish wines in two main marketplaces. Design/methodology/approach With
   the final target of increasing the company profits it has been designed
   and developed an application to track the prices of competitors for a
   set of products. This information will be used to set the product prices
   in order to offer the products both competitively and profitably in each
   Marketplace. This application must check, by tacking into account
   information such as the product cost or the minimum product margin, if
   it is possible to decrease the price in order to reach the top cheapest
   position and as a consequence, increase the sales. Findings The
   application improved in a notorious way the company's results in terms
   of sales and shipping costs. It must be said that without the use of the
   presented application, performing the price comparison process within
   each one of the marketplaces would have taken a long time. Moreover, as
   prices change very frequently, the obtained information has a very
   limited time value, and the competitors prices should be analyzed daily
   in order to take accurate decisions regarding the company's price
   policy. Originality/value Although the application has been designed for
   the wine sector and the two named marketplace, it could be exported to
   other sectors. For that, it should be implemented new modules to collect
   information regarding the competitor's price of the products selling on
   each corresponding marketplace.}},

Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1170-1184}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The consumption of organic food grows worldwide, increasing the
   need of studies seeking to understand factors influencing its
   consumption. To extend the understanding of organic food market, the
   present research seeks to explore the effect of perceived value on
   consumer trust and purchase intention in Brazil.
   Design/methodology/approach A survey with 274 Brazilian consumers of
   organic food was carried out. Perceived value was measured through four
   dimensions: functional, economic, social and emotional. The convergent
   and discriminant validities of latent variables were confirmed. The
   relationships among them were tested using structural equation modeling.
   Findings The results indicate that functional and emotional values
   positively affect consumer trust and that only emotional value motivates
   purchase intention. The trust had no direct influence on purchase
   intention. Thus, the perceived value is an important aspect in the
   prediction of trust and purchase intention among Brazilian consumers.
   Originality/value The identified results enlarge the understanding of
   Brazilian organic food market and consumer behavior and point out some
   opportunities for future research involving the subject.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I focus on the contrast between doing elegant, or peer
   impressing applied economics, and relevant applied economics that

   achieve relevance to those outside our profession. In particular, I
   examine several key areas of professional relevance. First, I examine
   how technological change can disrupt not only the industries we normally
   examine but also our profession. Second, I examine our dependence on
   available, quality data. From that perspective, I advocate for greater
   efforts and leadership with respect to data for our profession. Next, I
   examine our engagement with industry and our non-Ph.D. graduates. This
   leads me to pose the question of whether we would gain from great
   efforts to engage non-academic alumni of our departments? Finally, I
   draw upon my experiences with the policy makers to suggest we should
   walk a fine line between advocacy for our discipline, and science in
   general, while vigorously maintaining objectivity and nonpartisanship in
   our work.}},

Abstract = {{Social media offers numerous advantages for personal users and
   organizations to communicate, socialize, and market their products. When
   used correctly, social media is an effective tool to communicate and to
   share food safety news and good practices. However, there have been
   reports of fake food safety news shared via social media, fueling panic
   and resulting in a loss of revenue. Thus, this study aimed to
   investigate the consumers' awareness, trust, and usage of social media
   in communicating food safety news in Malaysia. A questionnaire divided
   into five sections-(i) demographics, (ii) reaction to food safety news,
   (iii) consumers' awareness, (iv) social media truth and level of trust,
   and (v) social media uses and content creation-was created and shared
   online. A total of 341 questionnaires were returned of which 339 surveys
   were valid. This study revealed that less than one-third of the study
   group (27.1\%) knew which of the food safety news were fake. Most
   respondents (67.8\%) were less likely to purchase the affected foods if
   the foods were featured in social media as problematic, although no
   differences were made between true and fake news and how that would
   influence respondents' willingness to purchase affected foods. Overall,
   62\% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed about the usage of
   social media and its ability to prevent food poisoning cases, while more
   than 50\% of the respondents were in total agreement that social media
   allow consumers to act more responsibly by sharing food safety news.
   Respondents tended to trust information shared by scientists (67.5\%)
   and family members and friends (33\%). Respondents would most often
   share the news after verifying its authenticity (46\%). If respondents
   experienced a personal food safety issue (e.g., discovered a fly in
   their meal), they seldom or never took photos to post online (56.1\%).
   It is possible that the respondents preferred to inform the food
   handlers and/or shop owners about the affected products rather than post
   the photos online. It is suggested that targeted food safety information
   and media literacy be provided to improve consumers' awareness and to
   positively influence self-verification of the food safety information
   before sharing. This study provides crucial insights for a range of
   stakeholders, particularly public authorities, food bloggers, and the
   public, in using social media effectively to build consumers' awareness
   and trust in food safety information.}},

Journal = {{FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Food product labels can provide consumers with rich, specific,
   expert-certified product information. However, sources of label
   information differ. How do consumers then evaluate label trustworthiness
   of expert labels in comparison to other commonly used label types? We
   present results from a representative online survey (N = 10,000) of
   consumers in Japan, the USA, Germany, China and Thailand using
   professionally designed labels for four food types (milk, honey, oil,
   wine) and five different sources of food information (farmers,
   government/administration, producer associations, experts, and
   consumers). We tested label legibility through identification of the
   label information source and asked respondents to evaluate the
   trustworthiness of labels using a six-scale instrument ranging from
   overall label trust to purchase intent. Results show that label
   legibility varied between countries, with expert labels scoring lowest.
   Nevertheless, respondents correctly identifying all label information
   sources chose expert labels as the most or second-most trustworthy
   across all countries and food types, while consumer labels scored low.
   Demographic factors exhibited weak influence. Results suggest expert
   labels might play an important role as trusted sources of information in
   an increasingly complex global food system. Finally, we consider the
   implications of the study for a potential institutionalization of expert
   labels based on the Japanese context.}},

Title = {{Food safety education attitude and practice among health professionals

Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{109}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Consumers trust health professionals (doctors, nurses, dietitians, and
   physicians) for food safety information. However, in the U.S., half
   health professionals are not confident with their food safety knowledge,
   and less than half of the health professionals provide food safety
   education to their patients. Little information on health professional
   food safety education awareness has been reported outside the U.S. In
   this study, health professionals from China, Peru, and the U.S. were
   contacted to explore their likelihood to and barriers to delivering food
   safety information. A semi-structured interview was used in China and
   Peru (n = 42) while in the U.S., focus groups (n = 27) and web-based
   surveys (n = 188) were used. The attitude and practice of health
   professionals, major barriers to information delivery, the information
   needed for food safety education, and effective delivery format were
   evaluated. The results indicated that nearly all the health
   professionals recognized the necessity of providing food safety
   education, but only 17 of 42 participants delivered food safety
   education in China and Peru while more than half participants delivered
   in the U.S. The three countries shared two main barriers in food safety
   education: 1) patients demonstrated lack of interest in this topic 2)
   health professionals did not have enough time to provide the food safety
   education. The findings provided evidence to guide the decision making
   for policymakers, educators and health professionals to develop the
   next-generation food safety education strategies for the public.}},

Title = {{Modeling Biowaste Biorefineries: A Review}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{The biorefining of biowaste is an upcoming novel strategy, but is mostly
   still in its conceptual phase. Biowaste biorefineries would allow
   (rural) communities to convert their biowaste into value-added biofuels,
   biochemical compounds, and fertilizers. Several different types of
   biowaste biorefineries have already been developed, but little to none
   of these designs are already commercially exploited. Their further
   development and commercial implementation is hampered by the high
   investment costs and risks, little trusts in its novel technologies,
   expected yields and profits, and operating reliability. Modeling these
   integrated processes, together with their supply chains, would allow for
   optimizing the considered biorefinery designs and coincidently speeding
   up the R\&D-process. The optimized biorefinery designs and supply chains
   would additionally embed an increased amount of trust in potential
   investors in terms of the economic sustainability of the considered
   novel processes. Therefore, in this publication, a summary of existing
   biorefinery models is presented, together with supply chain network
   models. The discussed biorefinery models are categorized according to
   the conversion platform they use, being thermochemical, biological, or
   hybrid ones. Furthermore, the overall inherent advantages and
   disadvantages of all conversion platforms are summarized and a scope of
   further research needs is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Organically farmed rice is believed to be healthier, safer, and
   eco-friendlier than its conventionally farmed counterparts and sells for
   a premium price in global markets. Deliberate mislabeling of organic
   rice has become a critical consumer concern in China and elsewhere, and
   there is an increased risk of buying fraudulent organic rice in the
   market place. In this study, stable isotopic and multielemental analysis
   combined with chemometrics was used to differentiate organically farmed
   rice from green and conventional rice in a 4-year experimental field
   trial from 2014 to 2017. A total of 108 rice samples and their
   associated soils were collected during the study from three farming
   (fertilization) systems to investigate whether there are long-term
   changes in the rice farming classification accuracy from climate
   effects. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios (i.e., delta C-13
   and delta N-15) and 27 elemental contents (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Fe, and Zn)
   of rice and soil samples were determined and then evaluated using
   statistical analysis {[}i.e., one-way analysis of variance,
   multivariable correlation analysis, and modeling of partial
   least-squares discriminant analysis]. Although delta N-15 values can be
   an effective indicator for organic rice authentication during one crop
   rotation, both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of rice were easily
   affected by rice cultivar and interannual soil fertilization and
   localized agroclimatic variations. These two isotopes were not able to
   separate organic rice from green and conventional rice accurately.
   Elemental contents of green and conventional rice (especially K and Ca)
   were found at higher levels due to the abundant application of synthetic
   fertilizers (e.g., KNO3, KH2PO4, and CaHPO4), unlike organically farmed
   rice, which primarily used animal manure and composts. Partial
   least-squares discriminant analysis modeling combined isotopic and
   elemental signatures to correctly differentiate organic rice from green
   and conventional counterparts, with an accuracy up to 100\% over the
   4-year study. Therefore, this multi-isotope and -element strategy
   proposes a more rigorous, alternative tool to combat fraudulent
   mislabeling of organic rice, increasing the trust of organically labeled
   rice products and supporting the integrity of the organic sector
   worldwide.}},

Title = {{Urban consumer trust in safe vegetables in Vietnam: The role of brand
   trust and the impact of consumer worry about vegetable safety}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{108}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Consumer trust in food safety based on system trust and brand trust has
   been studied thoroughly in developed countries, while such research is
   very few in developing nations. This study examines the role of system
   trust and brand trust in forming consumer trust in the safety of ``safe
   vegetables{''}, which is the official term used by the Vietnamese
   government to indicate vegetables certified as safe, in Vietnam.
   Besides, the impact of consumer worry about vegetable safety - a major
   problem in Vietnam - on the trust in the safety of safe vegetables is
   also evaluated. Based on a sample of 361 randomly chosen consumers from
   the urban districts of Hanoi, we deployed structural equation modeling
   to explore the factors associated with consumer trust in the safety of
   safe vegetables. Our main results show that brand trust plays the most
   vital role in building consumer trust in safe vegetables. In addition to
   the direct effect, brand trust also acts as a mediator between system
   trust and trust in the safety of safe vegetables. Interestingly,
   consumer worry about vegetable safety has two opposite effects on trust
   in safe vegetables: a direct negative impact and an indirect positive
   impact through brand trust. Based on the results, we propose important
   recommendations for improving consumer trust in safely branded food
   products in general, and safe vegetables in particular in Vietnam.}},

Title = {{Behind the label: Chinese consumers' trust in food certification and the
   effect of perceived quality on purchase intention}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{108}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate Chinese consumers' trust in food
   certification, and incorporates perceived quality as a new construct
   into the theory of planned behaviour to further analyze their purchase
   intention of certified food. The study conducted a survey of 844 Chinese
   consumers in twelve selected cities in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces by
   stratified sampling regarding their intention to purchase pork. Results
   from structural equation modelling analysis reveal that the proposed
   additional construct, i.e. perceived quality, as well as the traditional
   constructs, i.e. behavioural attitude, perceived behavioural control and
   subjective norm, have significant impacts on consumers' purchase
   intention. This paper also suggests that while food labelling serves its
   function of informing potential consumers about the commodity's quality,
   Chinese consumers hold different levels of trust in different labels,
   depending on the food certifying body, and that international bodies
   receive the highest confidence level. As this phenomenon might hinder
   the function of the food certification system, it has considerably
   policy implications. We make a number of recommendations on how the
   Chinese government can alleviate trust issues among consumers and other
   stakeholders.}},

Title = {{Issues surrounding consumer trust and acceptance of existing and
   emerging food processing technologies}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of food processing today is to make food safer, more
   nutritious and tastier, and to increase storage life. Consumers have a
   lack of trust in the way food is produced, formulated and processed,
   particularly with possible contaminants or chemical residues from
   production. Food manufacturers are not seen as being highly trusted
   sources. This may partly result from manufacturers' reluctance to share
   all information and to protect intellectual property via patents and
   thus maintain a competitive edge. There is a need to inform the consumer
   better about what operations the involved ingredients are subjected to
   and why. Various ways of food processing are reviewed. New food
   processing technologies face challenges when introduced and factors
   influencing consumers' and other stakeholders' acceptance should be part
   of decision-making process when adopting new technologies. Consumers'
   perception of risks is not the same as the risk assessment made by
   experts. A few specific cases are being discussed to further highlight
   the multiplicity of factors that may contribute to the development of a
   certain consumer perception about a product or a class of products. This
   is also linked to the emergence of certain terminologies that are
   associated with an increasingly negative perception of the processing of
   foods. We recommend more transparency on food formulation and food
   processing to restore consumer trust, which enables to take the
   advantage of the benefits different processing methods offer. Food
   manufacturers must make an effort to let consumers know how their food
   is being processed within the walls of the factory and highlight the
   benefits vis-a-vis preparing foods in a domestic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate supply chain relationships
   in an urban local fresh food system from a retailer perspective to
   examine the types of relationships and the factors underpinning the
   development of such relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Using the multiple case study method, interview data from twelve urban
   local fresh food retailers in Sydney were analysed using the thematic
   analysis.
   Findings
   This study finds that balanced power relationships in the supply chain
   allow reasonable power to sit with growers in product price
   determination irrespective of the dependency of small-scale growers on
   relatively large local retailers. Trust-based relationships are
   developed over multiple transactions, where shared values across the
   supply chain and consistently low opportunistic behaviour in reward
   sharing are demonstrated to be the crucial factors underpinning close
   relationships. This study also found evidence of horizontal supply chain
   linkages among retailers in a competitive environment.
   Originality/value
   This study extends the local food system literature dominated by rural
   studies to include new knowledge about the dynamics of collaborations in
   contemporary urban local fresh food supply chains. It provides the first
   empirical evidence of lateral inventory transshipment between retailers
   in a competitive environment confirming previous simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Institutional problems experienced by SMEs pose institutional risks that
   may affect their supply chain. The variables include involved actor,
   relationship and institution. The actor as a variable poses the risks of
   technical and intellectual knowledge, and negotiation skills, not to
   mention the issues of commitment, communication and responsibility. The
   relationship as a variable revolves around the issues of trust, honesty
   and motivation to improve, frequent conflicts, and limited information.
   Other institutional variables pose the risks of under-developed business
   networks and insufficient government involvement and training, and
   fundings. These risks must be handled properly and correctly. This study
   was aimed to identify and to assess institutional risks in supply
   chains. The risk identification and assessment in this research employed
   the Fuzzy Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (Fuzzy FMEA). The result from
   analysing five randomly selected SMEs revealed that the prioritised
   risks for actor as a variable included the lack of intellectual
   knowledge and poor commitment level. The prioritised risk for
   relationship as a variable was the lack of motivation to improve
   together. The prioritised risk for other institutional variables was the
   limited funding from other institution.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{425-445}},
Abstract = {{The importance of procurement relationships in food supply chains is
   increasing in importance due to issues of food safety, food security,
   changing consumer preferences, ethical concerns and greater awareness of
   the environmental impact of food production. Despite the considerable
   research on buyer-seller relationships in the marketing and management
   literature, only a small proportion of this has focused on procurement
   relationships between producers and buyers in food supply chains. Hence,
   this paper specifically focuses on examining the impact of relationship
   quality on supplier performance in the context of food supply chains.
   The theoretical framework is derived from the tenets of the
   resource-based view and the relational view of firms. Using this
   framework, the definition, measurement and structural dimensions of
   relationship quality is established in the context of food producers and
   buyers. This construct is then tested in relationship to supplier
   performance. Utilizing data from a mail survey of 954 red meat producers
   in New Zealand, the model of supplier-buyer relationship quality and its
   effects on supplier performance is tested using structural equation
   modelling. The results demonstrate that relationship quality is an
   essential factor in procurement relationships with suppliers in food
   supply chains and shows that, as hypothesized, higher quality
   relationships lead to positive performance outcomes. The results support
   the theoretical framework indicating that relationship quality,
   conceptualized and defined in this context, is indeed a valuable
   relational resource due to its impact on supplier performance.
   Managerially, this resource can be manipulated to improve supplier
   performance, and hence potentially provide firms with competitive
   advantage that has high replication barriers.}},

   Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) but the most of these researches

   purpose of this research was to investigate the public perception of CSR
   and their opinions regard the effect of new technologies in food
   production, with emphasize on genetically modified food (GMF). Empirical
   research was conducted in Vojvodina, as the region of Serbia, where food
   production is a dominant industry. The results showed that respondents
   mostly identify CSR with company's responsibility and moral obligation
   to society, especially for food production companies and recognize GMF
   as not offering benefits and unsafe. The trust in key actors is missing.
   In this regard, CSR awareness campaigns needs to be strengthened. (C)

   Statistical analysis of 241 valid questionnaires revealed that young
   farmers' intention to use innovative technologies was affected mainly by
   perceived organizational support, followed by average annual turnover,
   perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and sense of trust in the
   system supplier. This study suggests that agricultural administration
   agencies should consider farmers' farming needs and intention to use;
   agencies should employ problem-solving and design thinking when
   developing smart agriculture policies. Insightful design of incentives

Abstract = {{Small food businesses, because of their limited resources, are hard
   pressed to comply with the requirements of a conventional food safety
   management system (FSMS). To overcome it, the European legislation
   provides some flexibility in the application of FSMS. With this study,
   we evaluated the change in the perception and awareness of hazards in
   food production and in the attitudes of food business operators (FBOs)
   after a regional regulation was introduced to allow flexibility and a
   campaign of training activities on the FSMS simplification
   opportunities. Training activities targeting various stakeholders have
   been carried out in Piedmont region since 2014. A total of 283 FBOs from
   the dairy and the meat supply chains were recruited for a two-round
   survey. Overall, the majority of the FBOs believed that application of
   an FSMS helps to overcome official controls, to produce healthy foods,
   to better manage the production process, and for staff training; its
   usefulness for enhancing customer trust was judged of limited value. FBO
   knowledge on the possibility of simplifying the FSMS activities
   increased significantly between surveys, suggesting the success of the
   information campaigns. Over time, simplification increased in the meat
   but not in the dairy supply chain, where it involved nearly 70\% of
   FBOs. The cost of FSMS (mainly due to microbiological analysis) and the
   time it takes were the main reasons for FBO resistance to its
   application. Simplification of FSMS procedures were welcomed by the vast
   majority (>90\%) of FBOs. The perception of hazards was low and generic,
   suggesting the need for targeted training activities.}},

   Social Media: A Focus Group Study in Spain}},
Journal = {{FOODS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, an increasing number of consumers are demanding more
   information and more direct contact with food producers in order to
   avoid the various intermediaries in the supply chain, thus improving
   food traceability and price transfer. This has led to the development of
   more direct (short) food supply chains (SFSCs). Although consumer
   preferences to use SFSCs rather than traditional (long) supply chains
   have been widely researched in the literature, this study brings a new
   approach with the use of social media sites to build online SFSCs. A
   focus group approach with a total of 32 participants was used in this
   study with the main objective to understand consumers' awareness and
   acceptance of SFSCs. Special attention was given to the use of social
   media and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) as new approaches to support
   the creation of such alternative channels.}},

Title = {{The Role of Trust in Explaining Food Choice: Combining Choice Experiment
   and Attribute Best-Worst Scaling}},
Journal = {{FOODS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents empirical findings from a combination of two
   elicitation techniques-discrete choice experiment (DCE) and best-worst
   scaling (BWS)-to provide information about the role of consumers' trust
   in food choice decisions in the case of credence attributes. The
   analysis was based on a sample of 459 Taiwanese consumers and focuses on
   red sweet peppers. DCE data were examined using latent class analysis to
   investigate the importance and the utility different consumer segments
   attach to the production method, country of origin, and chemical residue
   testing. The relevance of attitudinal and trust-based items was
   identified by BWS using a hierarchical Bayesian mixed logit model and
   was aggregated to five latent components by means of principal component
   analysis. Applying a multinomial logit model, participants' latent class
   membership (obtained from DCE data) was regressed on the identified
   attitudinal and trust components, as well as demographic information.
   Results of the DCE latent class analysis for the product attributes show
   that four segments may be distinguished. Linking the DCE with the
   attitudinal dimensions reveals that consumers' attitude and trust
   significantly explain class membership and therefore, consumers'
   preferences for different credence attributes. Based on our results, we
   derive recommendations for industry and policy.}},

Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{329-352}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bargaining between consumer-product manufacturers and their retail
   customers is at least nominally constrained by the prohibitions on price
   discrimination of the Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) of 1936. However,
   because the RPA is generally regarded as being inconsistent with the
   anti-trust principle of protecting consumers, it is not often enforced
   by the Federal Trade Commission or the Anti-trust Division of the
   Department of Justice. Because of the perceived ineffectiveness of the
   RPA, it is unclear whether manufacturers follow the letter of the law,
   or actively bargain with their downstream customers. In this paper, we
   use data on wholesale and retail prices for yogurt products, and a
   Nash-in-Nash vertical bargaining model, to test whether the RPA
   represents a real constraint on bargaining between manufacturers and
   retailers. We find that this is not the case, and that vertical markets
   for consumer goods are more accurately characterized as
   bargaining-markets than markets regulated by the RPA. Further, we
   demonstrate that strict enforcement of the RPA would improve social
   welfare, but would not protect weak retailers.}},

Title = {{Decreasing consumers' risk perception of food additives by knowledge
   enhancement in China}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Food safety issues have occurred frequently in China in recent years,
   which results in consumers' high risk perception of food additives. In
   the present research, we examined whether knowledge would decrease
   Chinese consumers' risk perception of food additives under the influence
   of food safety issues' risk perception; we also investigated how
   information selection impacted popularization effectiveness. Study 1
   demonstrated that risk perception of food safety issues was positively
   correlated with risk perception of food additives. In addition, with
   increased risk perception of food safety issues, the higher level of
   knowledge weakened the influence of risk perception of food safety
   issues on risk perception of food additives. In Study 2, we proposed a
   consumer-riskfocused approach of knowledge popularization related to
   food additives, based on consumers' cognitive rules and concerns. We
   compared its popularization effectiveness with the
   comprehensive-knowledge-based approach at three time points. We found
   that the consumer-risk-focused approach significantly promoted the
   effectiveness of popularization, including increasing knowledge accuracy
   and trust, and decreasing risk perception. The present study provides
   evidence that risk perception of food safety issues leads to biased
   judgments and perceptions concerning food additives, but knowledge acts
   as a buffering function in this biased relationship. In addition, in
   terms of practical application, this study contributes to improving the
   effectiveness of knowledge popularization about food additives.}},

Title = {{The food neophobia scale (FNS): Exploration and confirmation of factor
   structure in a healthy Chinese sample}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Food neophobia, as a continuous personality trait, usually manifests in
   unwillingness to try, or even fear of trying unfamiliar food. The Food
   Neophobia Scale (FNS) is a measure designed to assess food neophobia.
   However, few studies have applied the FNS in a Chinese context.
   Therefore, this work aims to formulate and analyze a Chinese version of
   the FNS (FNS-C) using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA) with data gathered from a Chinese population. We
   examined the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the FNS-C by
   administering it to three samples, comprising a total of 1073 healthy
   Chinese college students. The first sample (N = 408) was used to examine
   the structure of the FNS for Chinese participants through EFA. The
   second sample (N = 615) was then used to verify the scale's factor
   structure through CFA. Results of the EFA suggested a three-factor model
   (Willingness, Trust, and Pickiness), instead of the two-factor models
   identified in all previous studies. The CFA results confirm these
   findings in the second sample. The third sample (N = 50) was used to
   assess the test-retest reliability. The FNS-C was found to have good
   reliability (internal consistency and test-retest stability) and
   validity. In conclusion, the FNS has three factors among Chinese
   participants, and the FNS-C performs properly with Chinese college
   students.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how consumers' trust is
   enhanced by e-commerce-based agribusiness companies. It also aims to
   shed light on the role of social commerce in improving consumers' trust.
   Design/methodology/approach To achieve the research purpose, an in-depth
   multiple case study is performed. In this study, three cases in short
   food supply chain (SFSC) in China are selected, and they are all
   e-commerce agribusiness companies. They adopted common ways to build up,
   maintain and reinforce consumers' trust. Findings It is revealed that
   the companies innovatively adopted social commerce, both online and
   offline, to overcome the trust problems usually faced by e-commerce
   companies. It is also shown that offline contact with potential
   consumers is an important first step for agribusiness e-commerce
   entrepreneurs to build up trust with consumers.
   Originality/value The study has mainly two contributions: first, it has
   managerial implications for agribusiness e-commerce entrepreneurs,
   addressing the important role of social presence in building up consumer
   trust. Second, it contributes to social presence and social relations
   literature by providing new empirical evidence from e-commerce in
   agri-food sector and in developing countries.}},

Title = {{Perspective: Talking About Mycotoxins}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Talking about mycotoxins amongst scientists often is easy, as the
   potential consequences are viewed from a perspective that breeds
   familiarity with potentially serious health problems. Translating
   objective results into information that can be used profitably by
   non-scientists is a task for which scientists often are poorly equipped.
   Experts in communications also have a difficult time with the mycotoxin
   issue because they lack the technical background to understand the
   causes, consequences and potential remedies associated with mycotoxin
   contamination. Our objective is to provide a framework for both
   scientists and communicators as they think about how to convey
   potentially scary food safety information to the public without causing
   a panic in the process. The major concerns people have about mycotoxin
   contamination are health- and financial-related, which makes addressing
   these concerns critical. Stakeholders along the food chain have
   different backgrounds and interests and should be identified and grouped
   for effective communications, as ``one size fits all{''} is not a good
   strategy. Similarly, distinguishing time-sensitive, e.g., crisis,
   communications from those that are time agnostic, e.g., background,

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze how brand
   authenticity (BA) as perceived by consumers who take health functional
   foods (HFF) strengthen the brand relationship quality (BRQ) and
   positively affects brand loyalty. Design/methodology/approach The five
   sub-dimensions of BA perceived by HFF consumers, elicited through a
   focus group interview, were conceptualized as a second-order reflective
   construct. To identify the influences of the sub-dimensions of BA on
   each construct of the BRQ and the influence on brand loyalty though
   mediating BRQ, an empirical analysis was done using partial least
   squares-based structural equation modeling. Findings All the
   sub-dimensions of BA positively affect each of the BRQ s (brand
   satisfaction, brand trust and brand commitment) excepting product
   authenticity on brand commitment, and originality on brand trust. The
   impact of BA positively affects brand loyalty by mediating brand
   relationship qualities. Originality/value It is found that BA is an
   important antecedent for forming BRQ with consumers in the HFF industry,
   in which building trust with consumers is important. BA is an important
   factor in brand management of HFF.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite the advantages ensuing from preferential market access
   agreements, trade exchanges between Southern Mediterranean Countries
   (SMCs) and the EU are often hindered by food safety issues. These are
   particularly relevant for fruit and vegetables, which are subject to
   heterogeneous regulations in SMCs. This paper seeks to outline
   governance solutions to improve ex-ante compliance capacity of SMCs
   production and to enhance integration with the EU market. A set of
   research hypotheses, concerning the difficulties and benefits related
   with food safety compliance, are formulated. These hypotheses are then
   discussed in the light of the empirical evidence gathered from (i)
   public bodies involved in food safety enforcement and (ii) a direct
   survey conducted on 37 stakeholders in the fruit and vegetable supply
   chain in Italy.
   The main problems identified relate to the scarce harmonization among
   control systems in EU Member States and insufficient checks in exporting
   countries. The main benefits include the reduction of sanitary risk and
   the reinforcement of long-term trust-based relations along the supply
   chain. The most promising strategies encompass the improvement of
   inspections on production sites and of infrastructures in the countries
   of origin. Further areas of intervention concern the harmonization of
   food safety regulation between EU countries and SMCs and the development
   of bilateral cooperation and technical training programs.}},

Abstract = {{The dairy value chain in Tunisia has been facing recurrent problems
   mostly related to coordination, contracting, pricing and quality
   imperfections. The policy focus on technology generation and
   dissemination, without considering the underlying problems related to
   market imperfections and institutional and socio-economic processes, has
   contributed to low technology adoption and limited development in the
   dairy value chain. This paper uses a gaming simulation approach to allow
   breeders to experiment and consider strategies of cooperation which lead
   to increased returns and improved quality of milk. The game allows
   understanding the role of trust and cooperation in improving the
   performance of the dairy value chain. The experiment was done in two
   regions and in four sessions each. Results show that benefits to
   breeders are derived from the price of milk which is determined by the
   number of cooperation in the repeated games strategies. The resulting
   Nash equilibrium is one where farmers cooperate without cheating. This
   solution avoids farmers the risk of rejection of milk and results in
   price increase as a result of the collective cooperative action.}},

Title = {{A systematic review of consumer perceptions of food fraud and
   authenticity: A European perspective}},
Journal = {{TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Food fraud results from deliberate criminal intent to
   adulterate or misrepresent food, food ingredients or packaging, and is
   motivated by economic gain. Its occurrence has been identified across
   various supply chains within local, regional and global food systems,
   including within Europe. Incidents of food fraud may negatively impact
   on consumer confidence of the food industry and in regulatory mechanisms
   designed to prevent or mitigate food fraud. A systematic analysis of the
   impacts of European food fraud incidents on European consumer
   perceptions and attitudes is presented.
   Scope and approach: Three databases were searched, yielding 15 studies.
   Thematic analysis of the results yielded six themes ``drivers of
   fraud{''}, ``consumer fraud concerns{''}, ``consumer perceptions and
   attitudes following a food fraud incident{''}, ``responsibility,
   accountability and blame{''} and ``consumer behavioural response{''},
   and ``supply chain responses{''}, but not increased food risk
   perceptions. This may be an artefact of the search language (English)
   used, the time period of the search (20 years from 1998) and because
   academic interest in food fraud as a distinct topic of study has been
   relatively recent, in particular from a risk perception perspective.
   Key findings and conclusions: Understanding consumer perceptions and
   attitudes towards food fraud, authenticity, and trust will facilitate
   industry and governmental priorities about food fraud prevention
   strategies, mitigatory actions and communication about these with the
   public. However, research is needed which links the perceptions and
   attitudes of consumers in countries to specific incidents, and to assess
   the impacts of preventative and mitigatory actions in relation to
   consumer confidence in affected food supply chains and food supply
   system more generally.}},

   intention}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Because numerous food safety problems have gained public attention,
   consumers are now focused on food safety and nutrition as well as health
   benefits. While traceability is considered the most effective
   intervention to ensure food safety, understanding how to encourage
   consumers to purchase traceable fresh food (TFF) is crucial in
   developing the safe food market. A questionnaire survey was conducted in
   Taiwan to explore the effects of the perception of TFF safety and
   nutrition on perceived health benefits, affective commitment, and
   repurchase intention. TFF consumers, defined as those who had purchased
   TFF in the past three months, were asked to participate in the study; in
   total, 393 valid questionnaires were collected. Results of structural
   equation modeling analysis indicated that consumers' TFF safety and
   nutrition perception affected their health benefit perceptions, which
   consequently influenced their affective commitment to TFF and repurchase
   intentions. These findings explain how TFF repurchase intentions are
   influenced by TFF safety and nutrition perception and health benefit
   perceptions. This paper provides some practical suggestions for TFF
   marketers to increase TFF consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify how the relationship
   between inbound logistics (IL) activities and elements of resilience
   (EoR) can contribute to organisational resilience.
   Design/methodology/approach Two in-depth case-based studies were
   conducted in the dairy industry. After identifying EoR and IL activities
   through a systematic literature review, relationships among them have
   been empirically discussed in six groups (emerged content analysis
   results): supplier and response capability; transportation; security;
   quick response to disruption; logistics management; trust and knowledge.
   Findings A framework was developed describing the contribution of these
   six groups to organisational resilience by highlighting and discussing
   three aspects: rigidity of the hierarchy, type of relationship and
   geographical dispersion. These aspects emerged from the process of
   content analysis and are related to the companies' characteristics.
   Originality/value Although some studies have discussed the IL
   contribution to generating resilience in companies, none of them have
   explored in detail the relationship between EoR and IL activities, and
   their contribution to organisational resilience. The proposed framework
   shows the contribution of the EoR to three different organisational

Abstract = {{The ``trust{''} attribute of health food has intensified the serious
   information asymmetry problem in the health food market. Moreover, it
   has strengthened the formation and influence of potential or hidden

   enterprise production and operation and government regulatory
   information disclosure from the perspective of consumer participation.
   The study fully considers the government's policy burdens and the degree
   of consumer response to food safety regulatory information. Moreover, it
   aims to explore the evolution mechanism of food enterprise production
   and operation strategies and government regulatory information
   disclosure strategies and analyze the evolution process of the
   government behavior in health food safety regulatory information
   disclosure. The theoretical derivation and simulation analysis found
   that the more sensitive consumers are to health food safety regulatory
   information, the more significant the profitability improvement of
   enterprises producing quality health food, thus urging the government to
   make an objective and comprehensive disclosure of health food safety

   LAFS actors played a primary role, giving rise to the sales of
   ``Parmigiano-Reggiano damaged by the earthquake{''} (PR-T). The purpose
   of this paper is to investigate the main determinants of PR-T purchasing
   using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB).
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey on 200 consumers was performed.
   Data were collected with face-to-face interviews in stores and markets
   where the PR-T has been sold, and analyzed by structural equation
   modelling.
   Findings - The TPB model predictors accounted for 52 per cent of the
   variance of intentions to purchase PR-T in the future and 21 per cent of
   the variance of behaviour. Perceived behavioural control is the main
   predictor of intention and behaviour, indicating that making easier the
   access to key resources and increasing people's capability seems a major
   aspect to reach the intended goals. Trust in producers and retailers
   communication, positive image of the PDO label, sense of belonging to
   the region of origin and socio-demographics, i.e. age and educational
   levels, are correlated with intention and behaviour. The food scare
   flare up in the media was not a reason impeding purchasing PR-T.
   Originality/value - These findings show the solidarity aspects
   underlying the collective purchases of PR-T in the aftermath of the 2012
   earthquake waves, and the importance of increasing people's capability
   and trust to reach the goal of facing dreadful food scares effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure Canadian attitudes
   towards genetic engineering in food, for both plant-based and livestock,
   assess trust towards food safety and overall regulatory system in
   Canada.
   Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study is derived from an
   inductive, quantitative analysis of primary data obtained from an online
   survey of adults, aged 18 and over, living in Canada for at least 12
   months. An online survey was widely distributed in both French and
   English. Data were collected from 1,049 respondents. The sample was
   randomized using regional and demographic benchmarks for an accurate
   representation of the Canadian population. The completion rate of the
   survey was 94 per cent. Based on the sampling design, the margin of
   error is 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20.
   Findings - Consumers misunderstand the nature of genetic engineering or
   do not appreciate its prevalence in agrifood or both. In total, 44 per
   cent of Canadians are confused about health effects of genetically
   engineered foods and ingredients. In total, 40 per cent believe that
   there is not significant testing on genetically engineered food to
   protect consumers. In total, 52 per cent are uncertain on their
   consumption of genetically engineered food, despite its prominence in
   the agrifood marketplace. Scientific literacy of respondents on genetic
   engineering is low. While Canadians are divided on purchasing
   genetically engineered animal-based products, 55 per cent indicated
   price is the most important factor when purchasing food.
   Research limitations/implications - More research is required to better
   appreciate the sociological and economic dimensions of incorporating
   GMfoods into our lives. Most importantly, longitudinal risks ought to be
   better understood for both plant- and animal-based GM foods and
   ingredients. Additional research is needed to quantify the benefits and
   risks of GM crops livestock, so business practices and policies approach
   market expectations. Significantly, improving consumers' scientific
   literacy on GM foods will reduce confusion and allow for more informed
   purchasing decisions. Indeed, a proactive research agenda on
   biotechnologies can accommodate well-informed discussions with public
   agencies, food businesses and consumers.
   Originality/value - This exploratory study is one of the first to
   compare consumers' perceptions of genetic engineering related to animal
   and plant-based species in Canada since the addition of genetically
   modified salmon to the marketplace.}},

   Purchasing in an Emerging Economy: An Extended TAM Approach}},
Journal = {{FOODS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Along with the development of the Internet and technology, food
   retailers have increasingly adopted online channels that enable
   consumers to buy food products online. This research aims to investigate
   the factors that influence consumer attitude and intention towards
   online food purchasing. A research framework was developed by combining
   the technology acceptance model with website trust, which is an
   important facilitator of online shopping. Using an online survey, data
   were obtained from 319 online food shoppers in an Asian emerging
   economy, i.e., Vietnam. Results from structural equation modeling show
   that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and website trust are
   important drivers of attitude towards online food purchasing. Among
   these drivers, perceived ease of use has the greatest impact on
   attitude. Additionally, attitude and website trust exert a direct and
   positive effect on intention towards online food purchasing. Taken
   together, these findings have important managerial implications for key
   stakeholders, such as online food retailers, associations, and policy
   makers. One key implication is that online food sellers must endeavor to
   make their websites simple to use, easy to navigate, reliable, and
   secure. Several potential caveats for future research studies are also
   presented in this paper.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Exposure to Fear-Related Body Odorants on Anxiety and

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SENSES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{683-692}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of literature documents how exposure to another person's
   fear-related body odorants can increase one's own anxiety and interfere
   with processing of social information, such as facial expression and
   impression formation. Building on these results, we aimed to 1) test the
   hypothesis that exposure to fear-related odorant would affect impression
   formation through fear contagion and 2) verify whether these effects can
   be observed in an ecologically valid (i.e., virtual) environment. We
   proposed that exposure to fear-related odorant would cause receivers to
   feel more anxious, which in turn would lead them to report less trust
   toward an unknown virtual character. This study had 2 distinct phases.
   First, we collected perspiration odorants from the armpits of 12 male
   senders (i.e., the source of the odorant) during the viewing of either
   fear or joy inducing film clips. In the second phase, 53 women receivers
   were exposed to either a fear, joy, or neutral odorant (i.e.,
   between-subjects design) by breathing through a gauze attached to a
   disposable respirator mask while immersed in a virtual bar. As expected,
   receivers exposed to fear odorants felt significantly more stressed.
   Mediation analysis also revealed an indirect effect of exposure on trust
   through anxiety. More specifically, the more anxious the receiver felt,
   the less she trusted the virtual character. Our results show for the
   first time that the impact of exposure to fear-related body odorants on
   negative interpersonal impression formation is mediated by the anxiety
   induced in the receiver.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of nonadherence to advice is recognized in several
   professional relationships, including the veterinarian-client
   relationship. A better understanding of farmer perspectives may help to
   improve efficiency in veterinary herd health management. This study
   aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively describe farmers' reasons for
   adherence and nonadherence with veterinary recommendations regarding
   preventive herd health measures. We carried out structured telephone
   interviews about implementation of preventive measures with owners or
   staff of 163 dairy farms and 6 beef farms. The farms had received an
   advisory visit by their veterinarian (n = 36), who had documented the
   preventive measures they had recommended. The interviewer noted verbatim
   responses to reasons for implementing preventive measures fully,
   partially, or not at all, and we analyzed these responses thematically.
   We also conducted a quantitative analysis, in which we calculated
   descriptive statistics of the proportions of different categories of
   reasons stated by the farmers. Altogether, 726 preventive measures
   (range per farm 1 to 17; median 3; interquartile range 2 to 6) were
   documented. We identified 3 organizing themes related to adherence or
   nonadherence with veterinary advice: trust, feasibility, and priorities.
   Overall, the most commonly stated reasons related to trust (in the
   veterinarian, in the advisory process, or in individual preventive
   measures). The most common reasons not to follow the recommended advice
   were related to feasibility. Based on the results, we recommend that, to
   improve adherence to their advice, veterinarians pay increased attention
   to farmers' needs, priorities, goals, and motives, as well as to
   farmers' perceptions of the effectiveness of individual preventive
   measures. We also recommend that veterinarians need to increase their
   focus on recommending preventive measures that are practically feasible
   to implement on farms.}},

   relational factors influencing the enactment of veterinary advice on
   dairy farms in the United Kingdom}},

Abstract = {{Achieving herd health and welfare improvement increasingly relies on
   cattle veterinarians to train and advise farmers, placing veterinary
   interactions at the heart of knowledge exchange. Cattle veterinarians
   recognize their influence and the need to be proactive advisors but
   struggle with acting upon this awareness in daily practice, reporting a
   need to enhance their advisory approach to inspire farmer behavior
   change. Understanding how veterinarian-farmer interactions positively or
   negatively influence the enactment of change on farm is therefore
   essential to support the cattle veterinary profession. This paper adopts
   a qualitative approach to conceptualize how and under what circumstances
   veterinary advice has the potential to support and inspire farmer
   engagement with behavior change on the UK dairy farm. Fourteen UK dairy
   farms were recruited to take part in a qualitative study involving
   research observation of a typical advisory consultation between
   veterinarian and farmer (n , 14) followed by separate, in-depth
   interviews with the farmer(s) and their respective veterinarian.
   Interview data were organized using a template coding method and
   analyzed thematically. While accuracy of veterinary advisory content was
   valued, it was a relational context of trust, shared veterinarian-farmer
   understanding, and meaningful interpretation of advice at a local
   (farmer) level that was most likely to enact change. Critically, these
   relational factors were reported to work together synergistically; a
   trusting relationship was an essential, but not necessarily sufficient,
   component to create a culture of change. Findings suggest that cattle
   veterinarians may benefit from tailoring advisory services to the
   farmer's specific world view, facilitated by a shared understanding of
   the farmer's immediate and long-term motivational drivers. In
   consequence, cattle veterinarians seeking to positively engage farmers
   in advisory interactions could consider a focus on farmer priorities,
   motivations, and goals as paramount to frame and inform advisory
   messages. This explicit collaborative communication encourages the
   selection of appropriate and timely veterinary expertise, leading to
   better integration and adoption of advice on farm given enhanced
   advisory relevance for farmers' unique circumstances. This
   farmer-centered approach, involving active co-creation of plans between
   individuals, is critical for engagement and commitment when tackling
   complex problems.}},

Title = {{How much can we trust polysorbates as food protein stabilizers - The
   case of bovine casein}},
Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{81-92}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Polysorbates are widely used in food and cosmetic products and
   pharmaceuticals for emulsion stabilization, preventing surface
   absorption and as stabilizers against protein aggregation. But their
   impacts on the secondary structure and conformational stabilization of
   bovine casein, a typical intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), have
   not been fully addressed so far, which is crucial to evaluate the
   performance of polysorbates as stabilizer for food products containing
   bovine casein. Here, we assessed the effects of polysorbate 20 (PS-20)
   and polysorbate 80 (PS-80) on the secondary structure and conformation
   of bovine casein micelles by fluorescence and circular dichroism
   spectra, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle x-ray scattering
   (SAXS) and transition electron microscopy (TEM). In addition,
   three-dimensional structure of bovine beta-casein, a major component of
   bovine casein, was predicted using homology modelling with the aid of
   PSIPRED server to outline the potential binding sites of bovine casein
   for polysorbates. We found that PS-20 presented a higher binding
   affinity (K-a = 3.76 x 10(6) M-1) and stoichiometry (n = 0.89) to bovine
   casein than that of PS-80 (K-a = 1.45 x 10(6) M-1 n = 0.45). The
   alpha-helical and beta-sheet conformation of bovine casein was increased
   upon binding with PS-20 whereas binding of PS-80 had little impact on
   secondary structural elements of this milk protein. Moreover, bovine
   casein micelles were dissociated by PS-20, which co-assembled into
   micellar-like particles with a rather spherical shape and homogenous
   size distribution ranging from 20 to 50 nm in diameter. The lauric acid
   chains may bind with disordered regions connected by colloidal calcium
   phosphate (CCP) as the core, and the sorbitan groups may associate with
   N-terminal outwards as the shell providing hydrophilicity to stabilize
   the polysorbates-casein complex. On the contrary, PS-80 led to formation
   of sponge-like aggregates with the radius ranging from 200 to 500 nm as
   indicated by the data of DLS, SAXS and TME. We assume that the stearic
   hindrance originating from oleic group and the kink due to the
   cis-double bond in the sidechain of PS-80 contribute to the aggregation
   of bovine casein induced by PS-80. Furthermore, a tentative binding
   mechanism of polysorbates with bovine casein micelles and model of
   complexes were proposed to illustrate the polysorbates-induced
   structural change and conformational stabilization of bovine casein
   micelles. Thus, we argue that the difference in binding of polysorbates
   to bovine casein may influence the functional properties
   (emulsification, foaming ability, etc) of milk protein. Taken together,
   we suggest that PS-20 may be preferred option as potential protein
   stabilizer for dairy products, and careful consideration should be given
   when selecting PS-80 as stabilizer for bovine casein, a typical IDP.}},

Abstract = {{Fraudulent acts regarding honey authenticity that use Apis mellifera
   honey as a substitute for Apis cerana honey have garnered considerable
   concern in China and triggered a trust crisis from consumers. In this
   study, untargeted metabolomics analysis was carried out based on
   volatile fractions in honey from A. cerana and A. mellifera using
   headspace gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS).
   Honey from A. cerana and A. mellifera was discriminated by HS-GC-IMS
   profiling, principal component analysis, and orthogonal partial
   least-squares discrimination analysis. Tentative markers were identified
   from p-values and the variable importance in projection analysis and
   confirmed using the retention index, mass fragments, and reference
   standards by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A targeted
   method was established using the headspace solid phase coupled with
   microextraction GC-MS (HS-SPME-GC-MS) to quantitate the markers. The
   results demonstrated that the developed untargeted and targeted
   metabolomics approach performed well when discriminating honey from A.
   cerana and A. mellifera.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the motivations to
   consume ecological foods in alternative food networks (AFNs).
   Design/methodology/approach In total, 150 questionnaires were applied;
   the questionnaire was adapted from Food Choice Questionnaire (Steptoe et
   al., 1995). Data were analyzed by means of multivariate statistics with
   factor and cluster analysis. In order to identify statistical
   differences (p<0.05), Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney nonparametric
   tests were performed.
   Findings Ten factors or motivations were found: social ecological
   concern, nutritional content, sensory aspects, certifications,
   naturalness, specialized consumption, trust in the seller, economic
   aspects, health and availability. Four groups were obtained and called:
   citizen consumers, in-process citizen consumers, conscious social
   consumers with no interest in certifications and conscious pragmatic
   consumers. It is concluded that differentiated consumers visit these
   establishments and their motivations are diverse, albeit they concur, to
   a varying extent, with the objectives of AFNs, finding a mixture of
   hedonic and ethical motivations.
   Practical implications This sort of works about specific places of
   consumption as well as specific consumers, in this case ecological,
   contributes to the development of future social research on other
   contexts, different consumers and products.
   Originality/value This sort of research has been carried out in various
   European cities, with a number of foods and over various sales channels;
   however, at present there is a debate around AFNs and the veracity of
   their goals. This way, the present work can contribute with an answer to
   whether the goals match the motivations of consumers.}},

Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{88}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Food safety is a very important topic in China. We investigate Chinese
   consumers' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for food
   traceability using a choice experiment. Given that consumers' trust in
   the food system may affect their preferences and WTP, we also assess the
   interaction between consumers' trust in government's supervision of food
   safety and food labels and consumers' preferences for traceable food
   products. Using data collected from a choice experiment on Fuji apples
   in a face-to-face survey in six Chinese cities, the results show that
   (i) consumers are willing to pay for traceable food but their valuations
   can differ upon the degree of their trust in government's supervision of
   food safety and food labels; (ii) consumers are willing to pay for
   traceability with strong evidence of preference heterogeneity; (iii)
   government is not the most trusted safety inspection and certificate
   authority as found in prior studies using animal food products in China.}},

   to buy branded rather than unbranded fresh milk products and that fresh
   milk carrying quality certifications is also preferred. We find evidence
   of both substitution and complementary effects between brands and
   certifications. Results from a latent class model reveal three latent
   consumer groups for fresh milk: brand/certification seekers,
   price-sensitive shoppers, and habitual buyers. Habitual buyers are loyal

Abstract = {{A series of food safety incidents related to domestically produced dairy
   in China harmed consumer confidence and caused a dramatic decrease in
   dairy consumption from 2008 to 2010. Compared with previous studies that
   mainly assessed consumer confidence in food or dairy in general, this
   study focused on 2 specific dairy products, milk and infant milk formula
   (IMF). Based on data from 934 Chinese consumers, confidence in the
   safety of milk and IMF was measured by using a multi-item scale with 2
   dimensions-optimism and pessimism. We found that Chinese consumers were
   optimistic about the safety of milk and IMF but, at the same time, were
   concerned about the risks related to milk and IMF. Chinese consumers
   have less confidence in IMF than in milk. Structural equation modeling
   indicated that consumer trust in manufacturers and third parties in the
   dairy supply chain and confidence in other foods, such as meat and fish,
   can foster consumer confidence in the safety of milk and IMF, while the
   extent of recall of the melamine infant formula incident in 2008 and
   trait worry exert negative effects. In addition, consumers with more
   children or less family income are likely to be more confident in
   domestically produced IMF. These insights into consumer confidence and
   its determinants can assist dairy supply chains and regulatory
   institutions in formulating effective risk communication strategies to
   strengthen consumer confidence.}},

Abstract = {{Respecting ethical beliefs of consumers is an important precondition for
   food manufacturers in their attempt to improve their positioning in the
   European food market. Based on a cross-cultural survey of 2511 European
   participants, this research demonstrates how ethical beliefs affect
   consumer perceptions of ``blue{''} (i.e. environmentally friendly)
   aquaculture products. The study further emphasises that the positive
   effect of ethical beliefs on purchase intention operates via an indirect
   route mediated by consumers' trust in a product category. Consumer
   involvement has limited moderation effect on the above relationships. To
   expand its ``blue{''} business, a key policy recommendation to
   aquaculture product manufacturers and policy makers is to urge stable
   and reliable standards of control in environmentally responsible
   aquaculture production so that consumers can rely on the information
   source and increase their trust in aquaculture products.}},

Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Meat adulteration is a significant economic problem as it can result in
   substantial economic gains and loss of consumers' trust in the food
   industry. Addition of a bulking agent masking the addition of water into
   minced meat is a fraudulent practice that is very difficult to detect.
   The quality of the meat can be assessed by measurement of total net
   protein, however the methods used to measure such property are not able
   to cope with the quite sophisticated modern-day adulteration practices.
   In our study, we assessed the potential of recently introduced Rapid
   Evaporative Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) technology to discover undeclared
   additives in chopped pork and chicken meat-based products such as
   sausages and burgers. The REIMS technique was able to discover such
   adulterants with a high degree of confidence when more than 2.5\% of
   these substances were added. The results could be obtained within a few
   minutes. In this context REIMS can be classified as a rapid screening
   method which could be employed as a front-line testing method to ensure
   the quality and authenticity of meat products.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a hypothetical choice experiment to examine farmers'

   that, on average, 36\% of farmers are willing to join such a platform.
   Participation is affected by the characteristics of both the platform
   and the farmer. The organization operating the big data platform is
   particularly important: farmers are most willing to share their data
   with university researchers and least willing to share their data with
   government. Not surprisingly, farmers with strong privacy preferences
   are less likely to join a big data platform. However, we found that
   relatively small financial and nonfinancial benefits significantly
   increased participation, even among farmers who stated strong privacy
   preferences. {[}EconLit classifications: Q12, Q16, Q18]}},

Abstract = {{Purpose From literature, an uncovered issue around the customer-based
   brand equity (CBBE) is detected: the influence of sensorial preferences
   on the relationship between social media communication and CBBE. The
   purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects produced by social
   media brand communication - both firm-created content (FCC) and
   user-generated content (UGC) - on CBBE, according to the sensorial
   preferences in the beer industry. Design/methodology/approach A
   literature review has been used to develop a research model and
   hypotheses. The research is based on online survey carried out on a
   sample of 183 valid questionnaires of Italian active fans and followers
   in the beer industry. A multi-group analysis applied to structural
   equation modeling is used. Findings The sensory dimension prevails
   limiting the operating range of brand awareness that does not strongly
   affect CBBE. In brand equity development' process, non-sensorial users
   do not consider sensorial preferences. The brand equity can become
   stronger by stimulating the reaction of customers through firms'
   communication by using social media platforms. Therefore, the quality of
   peer interactions in the social media communication has a positive
   impact on brand loyalty. When firms use social media communication to
   increase overall brand equity, they have to foster and monitor FCC and
   UGC responses that affect different CBBE components. Originality/value
   The paper provides empirical evidence about the relationship between
   social media communication and CBBE, according to the importance given
   to sensorial preferences by beer lovers. This can be considered as the
   first study on this specific topic focused on the CBBE issue.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the determinants offanners' participation in
   contract farming (CF) in the context of a transition country, namely
   Albania. The focus is on intermediaries' bargaining power effect on
   farmers' engagement in CF. Exploratory factor analysis is used to
   develop measures for the latent variables, while a logit regression
   model is employed to test the hypothesized relationship. The results
   show that intermediaries' bargaining power moderates negatively the
   relationship between farmers' specific investments and CF participation.
   Farmers' with high specific investment are reluctant to contract with
   buyers who have power because contracting with such a buyer implies that
   they can extract higher values from fanners' specific investments. Other
   strong predictors of contracting decision are fanners' trust on the
   intermediary, intermediary's advice to the farmer and intermediary's

Abstract = {{Background: Food authenticity is demanded by the consumer at all times.
   The consumer places trust in the manufacturer that the food product is
   genuine in terms of what is recorded on the packaging label. Objective:
   Recent advancements in LC tandem MS methodology in the detection of
   allergens, meat, and gelatin speciation in raw food products and
   processed foods are detailed in this paper. Method: For each of the
   three methods, initial proteome analysis and the screening leading to
   the determination of unique tryptic peptides were conducted using a
   high-resolution, accurate tandem mass spectrometer. Having identified
   the unique markers, the method was transferred to a tandem quadrupole
   mass spectrometer for a higher-sensitivity quantitative study, multiple
   reaction monitoring transition analysis. Results: For the allergens
   method a detection limit of at least 10 ppm was attained across the 12
   allergen peptides in this workflow. In the gluten workflow the resulting
   chromatograms show good detection down to 5 ppm, with no interference
   from the food matrices. The meat speciation method details that
   signature peptides could be readily identified at 1\% w/w with no matrix
   interference. Conclusions: These single-injection workflows with
   cycle-time optimization enable wide coverage of analytes to identify
   multiple species within challenging matrix samples.}},

Volume = {{131}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The procedures of risk assessment related to substances consumed or used
   by consumers (e.g., food additives, cleaning products) are highly
   complex and there exists some controversy between experts in regards to
   the uncertainty linked to it. This contributes to the well documented
   divergence in experts and lay-people's judgments, particularly for
   synthetic or man-made chemicals. By investigating lay-people's knowledge
   gaps and misconceptions related to toxicology, we hope to contribute to
   facilitating the communication between experts and the lay public. For
   this, a large-scale survey measuring knowledge of toxicological
   principles, trust in regulators, the irrational fear of chemicals and
   health concern was distributed in eight European countries (Total: N =
   5631). Results suggest that large gaps exist regarding people's
   knowledge of toxicological principles and that a lack of knowledge is
   significantly associated with higher levels of chemophobia. Particular
   attention for future communication efforts should be placed on the
   stigma associated with the terminology, principles of dose-response
   associations and the comparability of substances of natural and
   synthetic origin.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to investigate, from a psychological
   perspective, the elements that are able to predict attitudes to, and
   purchases of, organic products. Our specific focus was organic milk due
   to the reputation established by this product over the years, especially
   thanks to sales by large retailers. The analysis was performed within
   the theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior, which was
   extended to include trust in supply chain actors and self-identity of
   the consumers in question as ``green consumers{''}. A large sample of
   Italian consumers (n = 1509) was interviewed in two stages in order to
   obtain data regarding both intentions and actual behavior in respect of
   organic milk purchase. Our results suggest that TPB is, indeed, a
   predictive model for explaining organic milk purchase intentions and
   behavior. Furthermore, it can be successfully extended to elements such
   as self-identity and trust. Yet among all the dimensions of trust in the
   different actors of the supply chain, only trust in farmers was
   supported by our results. Therefore, campaigns aimed at fostering trust
   in farmers could reinforce the position of this food category when
   required.}},

Abstract = {{In order to encourage consumer informed decision making, it is in the
   interest of risk communicators in the food industry and authorities to
   facilitate consumer risk information sharing. Focusing on the risks of
   nanotechnology in food products, this study aimed to develop and test a
   model that describes the processes that result in the online sharing of
   risk information on food products. The model was based on the Theory of
   Planned Behaviour, the Risk Information Seeking and Processing model and
   the broader risk perception and communication literature. A
   cross-sectional online survey has been carried out among a
   representative sample of adults > 18 years of age in the Netherlands (n
   = 511). Attitude, self-efficacy, and injunctive and descriptive
   subjective norms in relation to information sharing were measured, as
   were information need, information seeking, trust, risk perception and
   anxiety in relation to the application of nanotechnology in food
   products. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to test the
   determinants of information sharing behaviour, and their relationships.
   Results showed that the intention to share information about the risks
   of nanotechnology in food online was medium-low. The hypothesized model
   as a whole fitted the data and nine of the fourteen path coefficients
   were highly significant. Results showed injunctive norms to be the main
   determinant of information sharing. Attitude and information seeking
   also contributed to the explanation of the variance in information
   sharing. Results are put into the perspective of relevant theoretical
   viewpoints and empirical findings. Implications for food risk
   communication and the facilitation of informed decision making are
   discussed.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine farmer preference for
   swine price index insurance in China focusing on whether Chinese farmers
   are willing to consider purchasing swine price index insurance, the
   premium they would like to pay, as well as the extend of heterogeneity
   in their preferences. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 443 swine
   farmers in Jiangsu and Henan provinces is collected and analyzed. An
   Ordered Probit model is used to analyze farmers' willingness to buy
   swine price index insurance and a Tobit model is used to analyze
   farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance premium. Findings
   Results show that some farmers are not willing to purchase swine price
   index insurance. However, WTP of majority of farmers is higher than what
   is prescribed in the current insurance policy. Factors affecting
   farmers' willingness to buy varied between two provinces. Experience in
   purchasing traditional swine insurance and risk perception affect
   farmers' willingness to buy in Jiangsu province, while joining
   agricultural cooperatives, experience in purchasing traditional swine
   insurance and understanding of swine price index insurance affect
   farmers' willingness to buy in Henan province. Farmers with
   non-agricultural income, longer years of swine breeding, higher degree
   of specialization, experience in purchasing traditional insurance,
   higher understanding of swine price index insurance and trust in local
   governments, stronger risk perception and risk preference, and not being
   a member of agricultural cooperatives have higher WTP. Originality/value
   Few studies have been conducted on swine price index insurance in China.
   Even less information, to the authors' knowledge, is available on farmer
   preferences. The research provides a timely contribution to understand
   the Chinese swine price index insurance market from the perspectives of
   farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth following the 1994
   Genocide. This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural
   sector, specifically farming intensification and the government's focus
   on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda's economic
   development has been impressive, many academics have argued that
   Rwanda's growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental
   regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of
   smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer
   loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five
   different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research
   on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have
   high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members
   who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and
   the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative
   to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have
   higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of
   Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the
   study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the
   mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative
   decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions
   as well as sustainable economic development.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The organic food sold in China can bear organic labels from
   different countries/regions. The purpose of this paper is to assess the
   trust and preferences of consumers for tomatoes carrying these different
   labels. Design/methodology/approach The data came from real choice
   experiments conducted in Shandong Province, China. A mixed logit model
   was used to analyze consumer willingness to pay (WTP). Findings Results
   indicated that, among the four organic labels considered in this study,
   the highest WTP was expressed for organic label from the European Union,
   followed by Hong Kong's organic label, Japanese organic label and,
   lastly, by the Chinese mainland organic label. Consumer trust has a
   positive effect on their WTPs for the four organic labels. Providing
   consumers with information on organic can significantly lift their WTPs,
   and reduce the gaps between WTPs for different organic labels.
   Originality/value This research is of academic value and of value to
   food suppliers. International food marketers are recommended to equip
   their products with proper organic labels and initiate additional
   consumer education.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate perceived sensory
   differences of organic and conventional leafy green vegetables through
   three sensory tests - blind, informed and inverted and the willingness
   to buy (WTB) them, and associated factors of organic food consumption by
   these students. Design/methodology/approach The research had a
   cross-sectional design with university students. First, a questionnaire
   with 16 statements was presented to 233 consumers with a five-point
   Likert scale response. The assertions were categorized into five
   domains: trust in organic production; trust in conventional production;
   positive attitude to organic; affordable price; and perceived quality.
   Afterwards, a hedonic scaling was conducted with 150 consumers, 50 in
   each type of test with conventional and organic leafy green vegetables:
   lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.); kale (Brassica oleracea L.); common chicory
   (Cichorium intybus); and endive (Cichorium endivia). Visual aspect,
   taste, texture, bitterness and overall liking for all samples were
   evaluated on a nine-point hedonic scale. Findings In general, the
   participants did not perceive sensory differences during the blind test,
   but when the information about the vegetables was provided, higher
   scores were obtained by those products labelled as organic in the
   informed test and in the inverted test (conventional labelled as
   organic). This effect was higher for students with stronger attitudes
   towards organic food. These results indicated that the perceived
   differences between organic and conventional leafy green by university
   students tended to be attitudinal and, therefore, can be greatly
   influenced by the information provided with the product.
   Originality/value This research showed that university students were
   influenced by the organic label, revealing their sensory perception
   about vegetables. This study had multiple methodological approaches,
   including hedonic scaling and consumers' WTB. This combination allowed
   identifying the students' attitudinal tendency in relation to their
   sensory perceptions of organic green leafy green vegetables.}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between science, risk assessment and risk management has
   always been complex, and even more so in a world increasingly
   characterised by rapid technical innovation, new modes of communication,
   suspicion about authorities and experts, and demands for people to have
   a say in decisions that are made on their behalf. In this challenging
   era where scientific advice on food safety has never been in greater
   demand, risk managers should effectively navigate the interplay between
   facts and values and be able to rely on robust and fit-for-purpose risk
   assessments to aid them. The fact that societal resistance is often
   encountered when scientific advice on food safety operates at a distance
   from social values and fails to actively engage with citizens, has led
   to increasing emphasis on the need to advance forms of risk assessment
   that are more contextual, and socially sound and accountable. EFSA's
   third Scientific Conference explored how risk assessments could be
   constructed to most usefully meet society's needs and thus connect
   science with society, while remaining scientifically robust.
   Contributors to the conference highlighted the need to: (1) frame risk
   assessments by clear policy goals and decision-making criteria; (2)
   begin risk assessments with an explicit problem formulation to identify
   relevant information; (3) make use of reliable risk assessment studies;
   (4) be explicit about value judgements; (5) address and communicate
   scientific uncertainty; (6) follow trustworthy processes; (7) publish
   the evidence and data, and report the way in which they are used in a
   transparent manner; (8) ensure effective communication throughout the
   risk analysis process; (9) involve society, as appropriate; and (10)
   weigh risks and benefits on request. Implementation of these
   recommendations would contribute to increased credibility and
   trustworthiness of food safety risk assessments. (C) 2019 European Food

Abstract = {{In democratic societies moving towards increased participation, it is
   more important than ever that the values, thoughts, understanding,
   attitudes and behaviours of the communities and public that we serve are
   properly and proportionately included in the evidence base for
   decision-making around risk, particularly when it comes to food. Not to
   do so undermines our trustworthiness and our licence to operate as
   regulators and is likely to compromise the quality and effectiveness of
   our communication. Moreover, each risk has its own characteristics that
   will affect how it is perceived and how it should be managed. This
   article sets out some of the ways that social research strategies,
   usually harnessing the direct input of citizens, contribute to the
   evidence base used for risk analysis and includes some practical
   examples of methods that have been used by the Food Standards Agency in

Abstract = {{This paper presents selected highlights from the `Engaging with society'
   session of EFSA's third Scientific Conference `Science, Food and
   Society' (Parma, Italy, 18-21 September 2018). The social dimension for
   scientific advisory bodies largely concerns science communication and
   public engagement. The political, economic and technological
   transformation of contemporary societies is challenging conventional
   structures and approaches in these areas. The disintermediation of
   communication and the proliferation of misinformation, it is argued,
   herald the onset of the post-truth society. A better understanding of
   the way individuals consume information today has led to the development
   of tools to guide mediators such as journalists and communication
   specialists in countering these trends. Public engagement can reinforce
   confidence in regulatory bodies and potentially contribute to the
   quality of the scientific process. Scientific advisory bodies in Europe
   have created strategies and mechanisms to engage the public that are
   designed to increase transparency and representativeness. To be
   effective, several engagement mechanisms are needed, although factors
   such as resource constraints, institutional culture and
   public/stakeholder attitudes may limit their development. In conclusion,
   a more vigorous role for social research is needed to place scientific
   risk assessment within broader socio-economic and political contexts.
   Social science expertise can help to define more impactful public
   information strategies and to explore the potential opportunities that
   engaged stakeholders and citizens can make to sustain and strengthen
   regulatory science. (C) 2019 European Food Safety Authority. EFSA

Abstract = {{Researchers and food system actors have developed a best practice model
   to assist with (re)building or maintaining consumer trust in the food
   system in the event of a food incident. The aim of the present study was
   to determine how well the model aligns with consumer views of the
   strategies required to maintain consumer trust during and following a
   food incident. This qualitative public deliberation study employed
   experimental, developmental vignettes during 2 full-day sessions in May
   2018. Following general discussion of the food incident scenario
   presented in the vignettes, 15 South Australian adults (in two groups)
   developed a collated and ranked list of key strategies to be used by
   food system actors during a food incident to assist in maintaining
   consumer trust. Participants were then introduced to the existing model,
   and engaged in discussions about if and how their strategies aligned
   with those in the existing model. Findings demonstrate broad consistency
   between the two groups and the model in the strategies identified as key
   for (re)building and maintaining consumer trust during a food incident.
   For example, timely transparency was reported by consumers as the key
   strategy for maintaining consumer trust during and after a food
   incident. However, participants expressed pessimism regarding actors'
   ability to implement strategies. Although minimal, differences were
   noted in strategy descriptions between the groups and the Model. This
   study suggests that overall the model is highly consistent with consumer
   views. If actors are to demonstrably apply the Model in the event of a
   food incident, our data suggest that the identified strategies will
   successfully assist them in (re)building and/or maintaining consumer
   trust in the food supply.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically the
   effects of different dimensions of social capital on the well-being of
   farmers in China's undeveloped poverty-stricken areas, and study the
   equivalent multiple of social capital and income compensation.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper opted for an exploratory study
   using the open-ended approach of grounded theory, including 1,176
   interviews with rural households in poverty-stricken areas in China. The
   data were complemented by documentary analysis. Then an econometric
   model of social capital and farmers' well-being was applied to the data.
   Findings The results show that the number frequently visiting relatives,
   reciprocity, participation and trust level are significantly positively
   related to the well-being of the farmers, and the level of participation
   in social capital requires the most income compensation, while the level
   of trust comes second. Originality/value This paper can serve as a
   template for developing a useful tool that can be fitted to national or
   regional data for studying the effects of social capital on the
   well-being of farmers in poor areas or countries and for calculating the
   concrete equivalent multiple of social capital and income compensation.}},

Title = {{Is It Possible to Promote Egg Consumption During Pregnancy? Findings
   From a Study on Knowledge, Perceptions, and Practices in Kenya}},

Abstract = {{Background: Eggs are nutrient rich and have the potential to improve
   maternal nutrition during pregnancy and birth outcomes, but cultural
   beliefs may inhibit consumption during pregnancy. Objective: To
   understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, practices, facilitators, and
   barriers related to consuming eggs during pregnancy in Kenya. Methods:
   The study had 3 phases. Phase I included in-depth interviews and
   free-listing and pile-sorting exercises with pregnant women (n = 36),
   husbands (n = 12), and mothers-in-law (n = 12) of pregnant women, and
   health providers (n = 24). Phase II involved egg preparation exercises
   with pregnant women (n = 39). Phase III involved a weeklong trial of egg
   consumption with pregnant women (n = 24). We used thematic content
   analysis methods to analyze qualitative data and tabulated quantitative
   data. Results: All participants recognized eggs as nutritious for
   pregnant women; 25\% of pregnant women consumed eggs the previous day.
   However, participants believed eating too many eggs during pregnancy (1
   or more eggs daily) leads to a large baby and delivery complications.
   Unaffordability and unavailability also inhibit consumption. Health
   workers are the most trusted source of information on maternal
   nutrition. Almost all women complied with the household trial, said they
   would continue eating eggs and would recommend eggs to other pregnant
   women in moderation. Conclusions: Although participants believed
   consuming eggs during pregnancy is beneficial, cultural norms,
   practices, and beliefs may prevent pregnant women from eating them
   daily. Interpersonal communication from health workers and agricultural
   policies to promote affordability could lead to increased consumption.}},

Title = {{Qualitative and quantitative cues in consumers' valuation of food
   safety: Evidence from Lebanon}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we explore consumers' behavior toward the joint provision
   of qualitative and quantitative food safety information. To this end, we
   conduct a choice experiment involving a representative sample of 700
   households from Beirut, Lebanon, designed around the purchase of a high
   risk Middle Eastern traditional street food, ``shawarma.{''} The
   surveyed household sample was divided among two treatments where one was
   provided with additional quantitative risk reduction information, hence
   labeled ``informed{''} versus the other which is labeled as
   ``uninformed{''}. Accordingly, we compare the willingness to pay (WTP)
   values between both informed and uninformed respondents given typical
   risk reduction levels using mixed-logit. The analysis illustrates that
   consumers were less likely to choose more expensive products-all else
   being equal-with the average consumer preferring to buy shawarma
   sandwiches from ``round the corner{''} shops as opposed to walking for
   more than 10 min, driving or ordering delivery. However, when food
   safety attributes were introduced preference shifted significantly
   toward food safety certification in all iterations as compared to no
   certification. This preference is independent of whether risk reduction
   information was provided. Nevertheless, once quantitative risk reduction
   information was shared, the results revealed a decrease in preference
   for food safety certificates. Accordingly, our results query the
   validity of incomplete risk information in food safety certifications
   and challenge some of the implications of risk communication on
   consumers' choice highlighting the need for improved and well-defined
   risk communication strategies. Practical applications Based on our
   results, we foresee a merit for public authorities in Lebanon to review
   and upgrade the current food safety monitoring and certification
   services and couple them with assertive and well-publicized risk
   reduction communication strategies. On the other hand, we suggest that
   the cost associated with these services should be heavily discounted or
   subsidized to benefit small and street food vendors. This will provide a
   powerful incentive for them to substantially improve on their food
   safety and hygiene practices. Given the evidence on the high premiums
   consumers are willing to pay for safer foods and transparent risk
   communication, such an incentive will become more persuasive for small
   food vendors. Accordingly, this will establish a robust market for
   street food safety in general and street foodborne risk communication in
   particular with considerable welfare gains to street food vendors which
   will ultimately shape consumer behavior.}},

Abstract = {{New food technologies, such as genetic modification, food fortification,
   and processing technologies, are of growing interest for future food
   security and safety. For ensuring successful implementation of such
   technologies, consumers and other food supply chain actors should
   embrace them. We present a systematic review to identify and compare key
   factors of supply chain actors' evaluation of new food technologies.
   Evaluation encompasses indicators such as likelihood or intention to
   perform a behavior, perceived benefits/risks, willingness to pay,
   acceptance/adoption, and attitudes. Results from 183 studies showed
   several imbalances in research. Although studies mainly focused on (1)
   genetically modified foods, (2) by consumers, (3) in developed
   countries, only very few studies have targeted other food technologies,
   other supply chain actors such as farmers (13 studies) or processors
   (two studies), or developing countries (43 studies). With respect to
   consumers' evaluation, key determinants were trust in institutions,
   information assessment, perceived risks and benefits, attitudes toward
   the product or technology, perceived behavioral control, quality
   perception of the product, and impact on health. Farmers' evaluation of
   new food technologies was explained by the factors of perceived risk and
   benefits and of actual source of information. For the few processor
   evaluation studies, no convergence of factors could be reached. This
   systematic review contributes to a better understanding of consumers'
   and farmers' evaluation behavior and opens up avenues for future
   research on supply chain actors' food technology evaluations. The
   differences in the conceptualization and measurement of extracted
   factors demonstrate the need for standardized approaches in future
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable farming is the main source of livelihood for smallholder
   farmers in Eswatini. However, the production and marketing challenges
   they faced inhibits the farmers from benefiting fully, which calls for
   relational transactions to enhance exchange efficiency. Therefore, this
   study aims to determine the nature of relationship constructs between
   vegetable farmers selling to formal and informal channels. Data elicited
   from 170 farmers were analysed using factor analysis, multiple
   regression analysis and discriminant analysis. Results revealed that
   farmers derived satisfaction from the price offered and communication,
   while trust was derived from satisfaction, communication and duration of
   the relationship, and commitment was derived from trust in both
   channels. The discriminant analysis results revealed that there is
   statistical significant difference between the channels. Farmers
   supplying formal markets perceived levels of satisfaction, trust, and
   commitment better than those supplying informal markets. The results
   also indicated that satisfaction and trust were the best predictors of
   the nature of the relationships. The lack of written contracts and low
   produce quantity purchased by the formal markets contributes to the
   low-level establishment of the farmer-buyer relationships. Therefore,
   coordinated supply chains and supplier-development approaches are
   necessary to complement the logistical requirements associated with
   fresh produce and to create mutual benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose How does the cereal industry innovate in selective partnerships?
   The purpose of this paper is to study the cereal industry and the
   crispbread success in terms of how different forms of openness jointly
   shape new product development (NPD). Design/methodology/approach A
   multiphase mixed methods design was used to combine three sets of data:
   a case study, sales figures and interviews with ten major actors in the
   Norwegian cereal industry. Findings Transparency and interaction with
   machinery suppliers appear to result in a more successful type of
   innovation. In practice, companies are more open than, perhaps, they
   realise. Factors such as mutual trust, asset control and distribution
   are positive for openness in innovation processes with suppliers.
   Originality/value Prior to 2011, Norway had no large-scale commercial
   crispbread production. Six years later, Norwegian production nears the
   sales figures of the leading Swedish brand Wasa. Is this due to OI?
   Understanding various forms of selective partnership, collaboration and
   trust among actors in the food industry is valuable for future growth.}},

Abstract = {{The world market for functional foods has grown dynamically and China is
   expected to be one of the most promising markets. But little is
   understood the formation mechanisms of consumers' purchase attitude and
   intention toward functional foods in Mainland China. The current study
   investigates the roles of trust, health consciousness and price in
   shaping consumers' purchase intention toward functional foods by
   focusing on purchase attitude as a mediator and food neophobia as a
   moderator. Results from the sample of 1144 Chinese suggest that Chinese
   consumers had moderate purchase intention toward functional foods. Trust
   in the food system and health consciousness positively affects purchase
   intention via purchase attitude. Price negatively affects purchase
   intention; meanwhile, the negative effect could be counteracted by
   health consciousness. Food neophobia does not directly affect
   individuals' purchase attitude or intention, but moderates the
   relationships between antecedents and them. Consumers with a low level
   of food neophobia treat higher price as a monetary sacrifice, while
   their counterparts may regard a higher price as a greater quality
   signal. The study offers the food industry insights into the development
   and marketing of functional foods targeted to the Mainland China market.}},

   Using the mixed method which combines data from our consumer survey and
   group discussions in Hanoi, we found that consumers experienced a high
   level of anxiety about food safety. In their eyes, pesticide residues,
   food preservatives, and hormone in livestock were top three risky
   hazards. As a result, vegetables, fruits, and meat were considered to be
   most unsafe. The concern about food safety was shaped by the fear of
   food hazards, risk perception of protein food, risk perception of
   vegetables and fruits, food risk information acquisition, and region.
   Region was the most important determinant of food safety concern,
   suggesting that spatial disparities exist. With a limited capacity to
   self-supply food and weaker social and kinship networks, urban consumers
   perceived a lower level of control over food safety. Their level of
   worry about food safety, therefore, was higher than their rural
   counterparts. Hence, urban farming is important, as it will help reduce
   urban consumers' distress about food safety. To eliminate consumer fear
   in both rural and urban regions, better risk communication aiming at
   educating consumers about food hazards is required. Trust in food can be
   restored by better control of hazards and the safety of common food
   products.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore stakeholders' views
   about quality and safety of edible oils from farm to industry and
   propose policy options to address these challenges. Methods:
   Semistructured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 11 experts
   in the edible oil industry. Participants were selected through purposive
   and snowball sampling. Open-ended interview questions were used to
   identify the edible oils' challenges from farm to industry. All
   interviews were recorded and final transcripts were re-read to obtain
   categories until themes were developed using directed content analysis
   and constant comparison methods. Results: Six categories in 14 themes
   with 49 sub themes were explored based on the perspectives of the
   stakeholders who were responsible for edible oil industry: (1) safety,
   (2) imports, (3) factory, (4) edible oils' monitoring, (5) edible oil
   industry, and (6) building consumer trust. The participants' views
   showed that to increase the quality and safety of edible oils, the
   following approaches are required: updating food safety regulations,
   effective inspection, monitoring and surveillance systems, updating
   laboratory equipment, and controlling the media advertising.
   Conclusions: In order to build and maintain effective edible oil safety
   systems, strong links must be established between all sectors
   responsible. The key players need to have access to reliable and
   up-to-date information so that timely collective action can be taken. It
   is recommended that governments face up to this task and lead the way.
   The research findings seek to offer policy options for government and
   the stakeholders for challenging future strategies for edible oil
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing use of internet, especially the proliferation of social
   networks has offered companies of all sectors the opportunity to keep in
   contact with their consumers; getting their feedbacks and complains on a
   daily basis and even to create short online chains enabling consumers to
   buy their products. This trend is found to be rather limited in the case
   of food products. The main objective of this article is to deal with
   consumer's perceptions towards the potential use of social media to
   create online short supply chains for food Projective techniques
   (Sentence completion tasks) have been used in this study. As, they allow
   researchers to uncover motivations, emotions and beliefs that drive
   consumer's perception and behavior which may not be detected by
   straightforward questioning. The findings of this study have allowed to
   obtain insight into those aspects that consumers regard as opportunities
   or barriers of such potential short food chains. The main aspect is to
   put food enterprises in the picture about what is going on in consumer's
   mind. This might open new possibilities for food businesses to develop a
   new short food chain.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Trading practices such as the take-back agreement (TBA) can become a
   tool for retailers to exert coercive power over suppliers when market
   concentration is high. We explore the implications of TBAs for the
   Swedish bread industry using unique company data from a premium bread
   supplier and find that powerful buyers over-order and, thereby, waste.
   This supplier faced 30\% returns on total volume produced in the period
   2011-2015 and had to bear the entire cost of bread rejections,
   collection and disposal. It received payment only for bread sold to
   end-customers, not the quantity supplied. To our knowledge, this is
   first time there is substantial evidence of the negative consequences
   such trading practices lead to with respect to waste. The EU has been
   considering banning the practices of `forcing the supplier to pay for
   wasted product' and `a buyer returning unsold food products to the
   supplier'. However, such behaviour is very difficult to prove, given
   that suppliers-buyers are either tied up with bilateral confidential
   contracts or operate under relational norms. Yet, TBAs are common in
   certain food supply chains, presenting a global challenge for prevention
   of food waste and requiring deeper policy engagement.}},

Title = {{Are Distributed Ledger Technologies the panacea for food traceability?}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{145-149}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as blockchain, has the
   potential to transform supply chains. It can provide a cryptographically
   secure and immutable record of transactions and associated metadata
   (origin, contracts, process steps, environmental variations, microbial
   records, etc.) linked across whole supply chains. The ability to trace
   food items within and along a supply chain is legally required by all
   actors within the chain. It is critical to food safety, underpins trust
   and global food trade. However, current food traceability systems are
   not linked between all actors within the supply chain. Key metadata on
   the age and process history of a food is rarely transferred when a
   product is bought and sold through multiple steps within the chain.
   Herein, we examine the potential of massively scalable DLT to securely
   link the entire food supply chain, from producer to end user. Under such
   a paradigm, should a food safety or quality issue ever arise, authorized
   end users could instantly and accurately trace the origin and history of
   any particular food item. This novel and unparalleled technology could
   help underpin trust for the safety of all food, a critical component of
   global food security. In this paper, we investigate the (i) data
   requirements to develop DLT technology across whole supply chains, (ii)
   key challenges and barriers to optimizing the complete system, and (iii)
   potential impacts on production efficiency, legal compliance, access to
   global food markets and the safety of food. Our conclusion is that while
   DLT has the potential to transform food systems, this can only be fully
   realized through the global development and agreement on suitable data
   standards and governance. In addition, key technical issues need to be
   resolved including challenges with DLT scalability, privacy and data
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of organics and country of origin (COO) on consumers' food
   choices have mostly been investigated separately. In order to
   investigate the joint effect of these two credence quality cues and when
   they influence choice, a choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiment was
   conducted in Germany, France, Denmark, China and Thailand. In each
   country, a sample of about 1000 consumers participated after being
   screened for responsibility for their household's shopping, consumption
   of the case product, and knowledge of organic food. A full factorial
   design with four COOS, three different organic label conditions and
   three price levels gave 36 different choice options. They were bundled
   in 12 choice sets of three alternatives, which were presented in random
   order. The product was either drinking milk or pork chops (random
   assignment). The study revealed a general preference for organics over
   conventional and for domestic over imported products, with exceptions to
   the latter in emerging markets. Among imported foods, there is a
   tendency to prefer foods from economically developed over less developed
   countries, also in the two Asian countries. Adding consistent quality
   cues have a decreasing marginal effect, but a favourable cue can
   compensate for an unfavourable one. The extent to which consumer choice
   is influenced by organic labels and COO depends on environmental
   concern, trust in countries as producers of organic food, and
   ethnocentrism.}},

Title = {{Sustainability of food and nutrition security policy during presidential
   transitions}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{195-203}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Developing countries with democratic governments periodically experience
   presidential transitions that affect political and institutional
   performance. Unforeseen uncertainties during transitions are not faced
   strategically and interrupt collaboration among country teams expected
   to jointly implement policies, including policies intended to contribute
   to food and nutrition security. In some low- and middle-income
   countries, these obstacles result in persistent hunger, malnutrition,
   and death mainly affecting the most vulnerable populations and
   contributing to unequal human development.
   We aimed to understand what mechanisms determined sustainability of Food
   and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP) during presidential transitions,
   from sociopolitical and nutritional perspectives, in a Central American
   country that experiences a change of president every four years.
   Purposeful criterion and snowball sampling were used to recruit 52
   policy actors from all relevant sectors and levels, elected or
   appointed, that had contributed to implementing the FNSP adopted since
   2006. Data from semi-structured interviews were analyzed using open,
   axial, and selective coding. Results were verified using content
   analysis for obtaining emerging themes in news, speeches, and documents.
   Twenty-four forces simultaneously shaped a dynamic process determining
   sustainability during transitions. The forces for sustaining FNSP were
   Backed Up, Beneficial, Championed, Importance, Institutionally Sound,
   Owned, Sensitive, Shared, Steady Resources, Strategic, Transition
   Effect, and Trusted. The forces for not sustaining FNSP were
   Antagonistic Underlying Structure, Campaigning, Dysfunctional
   Transition, Fractioned, Haphazard, Insensitive, Irrelevant,
   Misrepresentation, Neglected, Rivalry, Unsound Institutions, and
   Unsteady Resources. These forces determining FNSP sustainability during
   transitions were molded by the emerging reasons for sustaining and for
   not sustaining policy actions as reported by the study participants. The
   forces favored or impeded the sustainability of an action or part of it.
   The forces operated at all levels and sectors, but forces affected
   actions differently in these. The forces did not compete, but
   combinations of them brought about outcomes that policy actors in charge
   and their collaborators could intentionally influence. The potential of
   forces to shape sustainability of FSNP depended on interacting actors
   responding to emerging events within specific contexts. Roles performed
   by civil society, governmental officials, and international cooperation
   were critical for policy sustainability during transitions.
   These results are consistent with Lewin's Force Field Theory on the
   complex dynamics embedded in intersecting forces within contexts and
   identify the specific forces that were operating. Although the 24 forces
   were identified in one context, the set of forces likely captures the
   range of forces that may operate in other similar political contexts.
   The knowledge that such forces may be operating could be helpful in
   ensuring sustainability of policies in the future. Actors and other
   stakeholders can identify the predominant specific forces operating for
   a policy and activate or promote the forces that enhance sustainability
   and deactivate or suppress the forces that inhibit sustainability.
   Foreseeing or creating opportunities to activate (or deactivate) and
   promote (or suppress) forces during the early stages of a presidential
   transition could help sustain policies and related practices that
   benefit food and nutrition security.}},

Abstract = {{The livestock sector is a major driver of climate change, accounting for
   14.5\% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Population growth and
   rising prosperity are expected to see global consumption of meat rise by
   76\% by mid-century, a rate which is associated with significant social
   and environmental costs. There is therefore a compelling case for public
   measures to promote dietary shifts towards a more sustainable model, but
   little action has been taken at the international or national level.
   This article reports on an international study, with research conducted
   across the UK, US, China and Brazil, which examines the role the media
   might play in driving social change in this area. The study focused
   specifically on the negotiation of new information around meat
   consumption and climate change and its impacts on existing attitudes and
   behaviours. Findings indicate that perceptions and beliefs on climate
   change are culturally specific - tending to reflect national political
   and social priorities - but are contextualised within individually
   constructed media environments. Key determining factors include
   assessments of trust and credibility in regard to scientists and other
   experts, perceptions of the role of government and questions of
   individual versus collective responsibility. These shape the parameters
   within which arguments about the impact of meat consumption upon climate
   change are received, and these responses interact with cultural and
   structural barriers and opportunities to shape the likelihood of
   behaviour change.}},

Abstract = {{Linking smallholder farmers to high-value markets through contract
   farming has become an important strategy to increase farm incomes in
   developing countries. However, various forms of opportunistic behaviour
   have been reported, threatening the sustainability of inclusive supply
   chains. When formal institutions are weak, informal codes of conduct
   like trust can be important complements to facilitate market
   transactions. We explore the effect of opportunistic behaviour on
   farmers' trust, using a field-framed trust experiment with prior
   signaling with small-scale farmers in Ecuador. These farmers are linked
   to different types of markets, including high-value export chains, and
   have been exposed to varying levels of opportunistic behaviour in the
   past. Our unique dataset allows us to control for self-selection of game
   participants. We find that a positive signal triggers a positive
   response increasing trust, while a negative signal has no effect -
   possibly reflecting very low overall trust levels. In settings where
   market linkages have failed previously, ex-ante credible positive
   signals could help to build trust and encourage small farmers'
   participation in sustainable value chains.}},

Abstract = {{Farmers' markets prevail the most used channel for small farmers to get
   their products directly to customers. Who seek there mainly healthy,
   organic and local products with the additional value of direct contact
   with the farmer. Being local is thus a very useful element of the
   product in the field of marketing communication. The paper is aimed at
   two basic aspects gained through a questionnaire survey: defining the
   product locality from the customer's point of view and the real
   knowledge of the origin of purchased products. The results based on a
   case study in Czech Republic (Prague) identify the distance to the place
   of origin up to 48.2km as a limit for the customer to perceive the
   product as local. Furthermore, the survey identified that although the
   locality of the product is very important for customers, the average of
   72.4\% of customers did not know where the product they had already
   purchased was produced. Thus, the results suggest that people either
   believe in the localization of individual products as they are sold at
   the farmers' markets or trust the communication about the locality of
   the products. An important aspect for further research is to define the
   locality from the customer's point of view as a distances between the
   point of production and sales, and then to define the policy on farmers'
   markets in terms of local products labelling.}},

Title = {{Blockchainizing Food Law: Promises and Perils of Incorporating
   Distributed Ledger Technologies to Food Safety, Traceability, and
   Sustainability Governance}},
Journal = {{FOOD AND DRUG LAW JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{74}},

Pages = {{586-612}},
Abstract = {{Blockchain refers to distributed ledger technologies that can store,
   maintain, and update data collaboratively along a network of computing
   nodes. With the help of cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, and
   consensus mechanisms, data input to the blockchain is simultaneously and
   permanently recorded and updated in all the nodes of the network,
   ensuring a high level of consistency and authenticity of such data.
   Given such technological advantages, blockchain's potential to
   revolutionize the global food supply chain seems salient: transforming
   paper-based documents into a blockchain-enabled identity to generate a
   high level of transparency and data integrity, enabling smaller farmers
   to bypass middlemen in crops trading and cash transfers and providing an
   efficient and cost-effective way to manage the production system. In
   2017, IBM announced a collaboration with a few major food producers and
   retailers, including, inter alia, Dole, Nestle, Tyson Foods, Kroger,
   Unilever, and Walmart, to leverage disruptive technologies such as
   blockchain to enhance quality control, food safety, management, and
   traceability. Similarly, the United Nations World Food Program launched
   the ``Building Block{''} program in 2017, which uses iris-scanning
   technologies and blockchains to help Syrian refugees verify their
   identities and directly receive aid without intermediaries.
   Despite such promising development, blockchain is not a silver bullet to
   solve all food governance issues. Rather, there may be some new
   challenges that need to be adequately addressed. As argued by this
   Article, ``blockchainizing{''} governance of food safety, traceability,
   and sustainability may pose another layer of regulatory questions about
   technical capacity and infrastructure gap, scalability and
   implementation costs, global standardization politics, cybersecurity and
   data protection, and technologically inherent limits of blockchain. In
   addition, policy challenges to both developed and developing countries
   (albeit in different ways) in terms of operational expertise and
   technical infrastructure, scalability and implementation costs, and
   power asymmetry in international standard-setting cannot be ignored.
   More generally, this Article argues that such regulatory questions may
   call for a reconceptualization of the forms and substances of
   conventional food law and policy as well as data protection law,
   anti-trust law, and trade law. In this light, this Article calls for a
   more technologically informed policy-making process before rushing into
   the hype of blockchainizing food law.}},

Abstract = {{Stories are powerful and they have taken on a new dimension in the
   marketing world. Using storytelling or narrative as a communication
   technique can be an effective tool for persuasion, as well as way to
   connect with the consumer on shared values. But a simple narrative is
   not enough. It is in the evocation of emotions that the storytelling
   carries its power. The research presented in this paper shows that
   emotions are powerful: as a way to build trust, create closeness, hold
   attention and transport the reader/listener to another world - all of
   which can result in certain behavioral responses. This paper focuses on
   understanding storytelling in tourism context, specifically in wine
   tourism. Wine tourism provides the producer the chance to tell their
   story and build a special relationship. The winery experience opens up
   greater possibilities to stimulate good feelings for the visitor.
   Coupled with a compelling narrative that takes the wine tourist on a
   physical and emotional journey, the ability to sell the brand becomes
   possible. The case study presented in this paper is Quinta do Vallado,
   in the Douro Valley, Portugal. It will show how the script that was used
   to communicate with the visitor was transformed into a compelling
   narrative.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there is an increasing interest in developing meat
   products with healthier attributes. Consumers' behavior and expectations
   about sensory evaluation of traditional meat products is becoming less
   predictable. This paper reviews consumers' perception and acceptance of
   selected meat products from Serbia regarding content of fat and salt.
   Chicken and beef salami were sensory evaluated by consumers (n=3291)
   between 2014-2018. Sensory evaluation of the products was conducted
   according to a modified version of a DLG-5-points-scheme. The
   questionnaire started with general questions on demographic information
   about the respondents. Consumers rated the taste as good, satisfactory
   or unsatisfactory; the salt content as balanced, not salty enough or too
   salty; and the fat content as sufficient or too fatty. This
   investigation shows that Serbian consumers have become more interested
   in meat products with lower salt and fat contents. Consumers' trust and
   eating habits have changed over the years, and consequently, their
   acceptance of the products has also changed. Since consumer perceptions
   have a direct influence on meat industry profitability, the meat
   industry needs to know which attributes of meat products are considered
   important by consumers.}},

Pages = {{2365-2378}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure and assess the level
   of food safety culture (FSC) in the restaurant operating in the SUBWAY
   franchise network.
   Design/methodology/approach - The case study accompanied by the
   questionnaire built of 38 items grouped into five areas/sections:
   management style/food safety (FS) policy, leadership, communication,
   commitment and work environment.
   Findings - The level of FSC is 3.83 on a 1-5 scale. It requires further
   improvement and taking greater care of FS. The work environment and
   management style/FS policy were assessed the highest, while leadership
   and communication the lowest. There is a need to increase the frequency
   of meetings that address the issue of FS, ensure a better atmosphere of
   mutual trust and sharing knowledge about potential problems. It is also
   necessary to appreciate FS initiatives as well as review the number and
   suitability of existing procedures.
   Research limitations/implications - In further studies, the case study
   accompanied by a questionnaire could be supported by additional
   qualitative methods, e.g. interviews with employees, observations or
   mystery shopping.
   Practical implications - The results may help managers to verify and
   improve the overall FS policy in the restaurant and to encourage ongoing
   assessment of FSC in other franchise network entities that will take
   into account the critical aspects of FSC indicated in the case study.
   Originality/value - In the literature, the issue of the role and meaning
   as well as the assessment of FSC has been undertaken for many years;
   however, there are no papers considering small restaurants fromCentral
   Europe. This is also the first paper in Poland that addresses the aspect
   of FSC and its assessment.}},

Title = {{A crisis of consumers' trust in scientists and its influence on consumer
   attitude toward genetically modified foods}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2454-2476}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine Chinese consumers'
   attitudes toward genetically modified (GM) foods and the impact that
   consumers' trust in different actors - GM scientists, non-GM scientists
   or individuals, the government and the media, has on their attitudes.
   Design/methodology/approach - Consumers in Beijing were surveyed about
   their attitudes toward GM foods and their trust in different actors. The
   surveys were conducted from June to July of 2015. The sample size is
   1,460 people. Given the potential endogeneity of trust variable,
   bivariate probit models are employed to estimate the impact of trust in
   different actors on consumers' attitudes.
   Findings - The results show that 55 percent of the Chinese consumers are
   opposed to GM foods and nearly 60 percent do not trust GM scientists. In
   total, 42 percent of Chinese consumers trust in the government and 39
   percent trust the non-GM scientists or individuals. Around 35 percent of
   consumers believe the misinformation on GM technology that were provided
   by the media. Trust in the GM scientists and trust in the government
   have a significant positive impact on consumers' acceptance of GM foods
   while trust in the non-GM scientists or individuals and believing the
   misinformation have a significant negative effect on the acceptance.
   Nearly 70 percent of Chinese consumers acquired information about GM
   food safety from the internet or via WeChat. Consumers who acquired GM
   technology information from the internet or via WeChat are less likely
   to embrace GM foods than those who obtain information from other
   sources.
   Originality/value - Consumer trust plays a crucial role to accept
   biotech products in the market and it is crucial for producers, policy
   makers and consumers to have faith in new biotech products. The results
   of this study suggest that the government and GM scientists should make
   more effort to gain the trust and support of consumers, while the media
   should provide objective reports on GM products based on scientific
   evidence.}},

Title = {{Plant-based foods in Canada: information, trust and closing the
   commercialization gap}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2535-2550}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Despite the growing awareness of links between meat
   consumption and human, animal and environmental health, consumption
   rates of protein rich plant-based foods (PBFs) in Canada remain
   relatively low. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how
   information sources and trust relate to PBFs in Canadians' diets, and
   how these variablesmay factor into closing the commercialization gap for
   PBFs in Canada.
   Design/methodology/approach - A geographically representative sample of
   Canadians (n = 410) participated in a 20-minute, online survey. The
   survey consists of 24 questions covering demographic characteristics,
   motivations behind current and future food choices, frequency of current
   PBF consumption, sources of information about PBFs and trust levels of
   these sources.
   Findings - Most Canadians get information about PBFs from labels, the
   internet and family and friends, but only half trust these sources to
   provide accurate information. Sources of information (e.g. licensed
   health care professionals) that rank high in trust are only consulted by
   a minority of respondents. Several information sources (e.g. family and
   friends) are associated with consumers' willingness to try new PBFs,
   whereas other sources (e.g. labels) are associated with Canadians being
   unlikely to try new PBFs.
   Originality/value - Understanding the patterns of where Canadians access
   information about PBFs and what sources of information are trusted can
   help to strategically place information about PBF qualities among select
   information sources and to remove some of the information barriers
   contributing to the PBF commercialization gap.}},

Pages = {{781-794}},
Abstract = {{The majority of Taiwanese consumers are not familiar with halal food,
   although the halal diet has been a global trend highlighting three
   attributes: cleanliness, animal welfare, and religious norms. This study
   explores the purchase intention of traditional market consumers in
   buying halal-labeled chicken measured by their willingness-to-pay (WTP).
   A total of 904 valid survey samples were collected in May 2017. A logit
   model and interval regression analysis are adopted to analyze the
   purchase intention and to elicit the WTP for halal-labeled chicken in
   traditional markets. Results show that although the attribute of
   religious norms still influences a small group of consumers, the
   majority of consumers for halal-labeled chicken in traditional markets
   are attracted to the attributes of cleanliness and animal welfare.
   Facing the ever-changing new market trend, this study can prove useful
   for government and enterprises in planning the marketing strategy and
   the development of local halal food products.}},

   fight poverty; do not trust in the local or woreda authorities; perceive
   that their local authorities are not accountable; think that their local
   authorities are not transparent; perceive that their local authorities
   are not participatory; and know that their local authorities demand
   bribe to provide services to the conununity. Similarly, the econometric

   on development of learning and research in the fields of mathematics and
   applied sciences. The 11 laboratories the faculty are serving practical
   of subjects for FMIPA and some other faculties in the university. This
   study implements Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) and Student
   Satisfaction Index (CSI) to assess the degree of importance and
   performance of the Critical Success Factors (CSF), from the perspective
   of students. This research presents an important contribution because it
   allowed us to identify the level of satisfaction of the students of the
   laboratories based on the performance, such study never been carried out
   before. The results show that the CSI is 72\%, which means that the
   majority of students are satisfied with the performance of the service
   quality. Meanwhile, the results of IPA indicate that the improvement
   priorities have be carried out on un-adequate equipment for practicum;
   many equipment are not calibrated; un easy to have access to equipment
   and supply. There is no assurance on trust and safety in service.
   Students consider staff considered not friendly enough to students, do
   not provide enough information needed by the students. Some practical of
   subject from other faculties were terminated due to lack of relevancy
   between practical items and the subject syllabus. These attributes are
   the top priority because the importance level is high while the
   performance level is low}},

Abstract = {{An important issue facing marketing cooperatives is that the overall
   quality of the product depends on the quality of farm products provided
   by individual members. We conduct an experiment to empirically
   investigate producer incentives to free-ride on quality among the
   members of a marketing cooperative in a setting where the average
   quality provided by cooperative members results in a collective rent
   that is distributed back to members in a patronage dividend levied in
   proportion to the quantity produced. Hidden actions by cooperative
   members that impact quality are imperfectly monitored, but free-riding,
   when detected, results in exclusion from cooperative returns. The
   randomized payoff structure of our game results in a novel experimental
   design that nests public good games and multi-player assurance games.
   Our findings indicate that free-riding on product quality is deterred
   when (a) cooperatives base patronage dividends on quality outcomes of
   smaller groups; (b) payoffs from free-riding are randomized by the
   possibility of exclusion from cooperative returns; and (c) cooperatives
   distribute a larger share of returns to members through indirect
   payments such as capital pooling and cost-sharing arrangements unrelated
   to product quality.}},

Title = {{Consumers' anti-consumption behavior toward organic food purchase: an
   analysis using SEM}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{104-122}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors
   affecting anti-consumption behavior of the consumers toward organic food
   purchase: in particular, how do individual beliefs about trustworthiness
   of organic foods, normative structure of social pressure and
   self-efficacy affect individual intentions to make organic food
   purchases and actual purchasing behavior? To answer this question, a
   theoretical framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as its
   foundation has been established. Using measurement scales in order to
   measure different aspects of trustworthiness, normative structure,
   self-efficacy, attitude, perceived behavioral control (PBC) and
   subjective norms, a survey instrument has been developed to examine the
   several associations implied by the model of TPB.
   Design/methodology/approach In doing so, data on a structured
   questionnaire were collected from various parts of a city based on
   convenience random sampling procedure. The respondents were interviewed
   face-to-face to collect information on a structured questionnaire. Data
   (n=337) were analyzed using a research framework formulated based on the
   TPB through the structural equation modeling procedure.
   Findings The findings of the study indicate that among the seven
   independent variables of trustworthiness, normative structure,
   self-efficacy, attitude, subjective norm and PBC, only subjective norm
   has not been statistically significant to influence organic food
   purchase behavior.
   Research limitations/implications The result implies that various
   sociopolitical forces and skewed monthly incomes are inhibiting the
   consumers (anti-consumption) to increasingly buy the organic food
   products.
   Practical implications In this regard, government, policy planners,
   academia as well as media have profound roles to play to encourage
   people to buy more organic food for their health safety and overall
   consumer well-being.
   Originality/value This research is based on primary data collected from
   the respondents of a sub-urban areas of a metropolitan city. The
   findings will help formulate a sound food policy for ensuring social
   well-being of the consumers.}},

Title = {{Consumers' behaviour in fast-food restaurants: a food value perspective
   from Spain}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{386-399}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand consumers' behaviour
   in fast-food restaurants in Spain. To this end, the authors conducted a
   survey that combined a classification of food values, as proposed in the
   relevant literature, with a related model that links personal values to
   behaviour.
   Design/methodology/approach A sample of 400 consumers was gathered from
   two different, leading fast-food chains operating in Spain. With these
   data, respondents were grouped through hierarchical cluster analysis and
   K-measures, and in accordance with Lusk and Briggeman's (2009) food
   values and the food-related lifestyle model. The authors validated these
   clusters by means of ANOVA and discriminant analysis, which led to
   useful observations about inter-group differences in consumers' habits,
   as well as their satisfaction, trust and loyalty.
   Findings The results indicate that consumers can be clustered into three
   groups based their food values assessments: the mainly utilitarian
   group, the mainly hedonic group and the ethical values group. These
   groups not only demonstrate diverse habits, but also differ on key
   variables such as satisfaction, trust and loyalty.
   Practical implications The authors offer several managerial
   recommendations for designing and developing segmentation strategies in
   the fast-food industry. Any such strategies should acknowledge that all
   consumer groups appear to value restaurants' efforts to provide them
   with both hedonic and utilitarian benefits, although the extent varies
   across groups.
   Originality/value Among the relevant literature, this research is the
   only one that examines the existence of distinct consumer groups based
   on their food values assessments. In addition, this paper analyses
   inter-group differences in terms of both diverse consumptions habits
   (frequency of visits, expenditure, etc.) and key marketing variables
   (satisfaction, trust and loyalty).}},

Title = {{Food-system actors' perspectives on trust: an international comparison}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{561-573}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to compare the perspectives of
   actors who contribute to trust in the food system in four high income
   countries which have diverse food incident histories: Australia, New
   Zealand (NZ), the United Kingdom (UK) and the Island of Ireland (IOI),
   focussing on their communication with the public, and their approach to
   food system interrelationships.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in two separate studies:
   the first in Australia, NZ and the UK (Study 1); and the second on the
   IOI (Study 2). In-depth interviews were conducted with media, food
   industry and food regulatory actors across the four regions (n=105,
   Study 1; n=50, Study 2). Analysis focussed on identifying similarities
   and differences in the perspectives of actors from the four regions
   regarding the key themes of communication with the public, and
   relationships between media, industry and regulators.
   Findings While there were many similarities in the way food system
   actors from the four regions discussed (re)building trust in the context
   of a food incident, their perceptions differed in a number of critical
   ways regarding food system actor use of social media, and the attitudes
   and approaches towards relationships between food system actors.
   Originality/value This paper outlines opportunities for the regions
   studied to learn from each other when looking for practical strategies
   to maximise consumer trust in the food system, particularly relating to
   the use of social media and attitudes towards role definition in
   industry-regulator relationships.}},

   importance of website characteristics as antecedents of e-loyalty in
   online grocery retailing.
   Originality/value Albeit the explored phenomenon has been subject to
   extensive study, some of its facets are yet to be fully explored. In
   particular, though the influence of e-trust, e-satisfaction and
   e-commitment on e-loyalty has been shown, little attention has been paid
   to the factors affecting these three antecedents of e-loyalty. In this

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the social institutions
   of trust, accountability and corporate shared value in creating an
   enabling environment for private sector investment in African
   agricultural and food systems.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses mixed methods. A value chain
   framework models interactions among stakeholders in the agriculture,
   agribusiness and food sectors. The social institutions of accountability
   and trust are introduced into the model, followed by a Rwanda premium
   coffee value chain case study.
   Findings The conceptual and case study results show that best practices
   can increase smallholder farmer, agricultural service provider,
   financial intermediary, and food processor investments in and benefits
   from the agriculture sector.
   Research limitations/implications Further research is needed on the
   economic foundations of development cooperation based on trust,
   accountability and shared values, best practices and the link with
   desired societal outcomes, such as the sustainable development goals.
   Social implications Mutual accountability processes, as they are
   maturing in Africa, are at the cutting edge of creating processes where
   multiple stakeholders, including agribusiness, can come together to make
   joint commitments to a shared development agenda, and where stakeholders
   hold themselves and others accountable for meeting these commitments.

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{139-158}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between
   the existence of asset specificity and the architecture of the hybrid
   governance structures adopted by horticultural smallholders from the
   Brazilian region of Serra Fluminense.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a negative binomial
   regression model to analyze 567 transactions carried out by
   horticultural smallholders from the Brazilian region of Serra
   Fluminense. Starting from the insights of Oliver Williamson's
   transaction cost economics, an indicator is constructed with the goal to
   capture the degree of intensity of coordination from the adoption of
   diverse bundles of coordination mechanisms in a governance structure.
   Findings The results show that higher levels of human and physical asset
   specificity affect the intensity of coordination of the transactions in
   the sample, leading to the adoption of hybrid forms with more complex
   bundles of coordination mechanisms.
   Research limitations/implications This paper adds to a growing
   literature that studies the architecture of complex governance
   structures. However, its empirical conclusions are exploratory.
   Originality/value The contribution of this paper is twofold. First,
   quantitative empirical studies that analyze the diversity of hybrid
   forms in the same industry are relatively rare. This contribution also
   presents a theoretical discussion that might inform scholars dealing

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{159-174}},
Abstract = {{Purpose With recent shifts in market forces driven by food safety and
   quality concerns, managers in the Brazilian beef processing industry are
   forced to reevaluate their procurement arrangements with cattle
   producers. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight on the effect
   of live-weight (LW) and dead-weight (DW) procurement arrangements on
   farmers' incentives to invest in cattle quality.
   Design/methodology/approach The research methods involve a conceptual
   model based on principal-agent framework and data from targeted
   interviews of cattle farmers and slaughterhouse managers in the Western
   Region of SAo Paulo state of Brazil.
   Findings Findings highlight the potential for adverse selection of
   low-quality cattle producers under LW arrangement and misaligned
   incentives for quality improvement, they also illustrate incentive
   compatibility of DW arrangement when the carcass yield is verifiable by
   producers. The evidence from field data was largely consistent with the
   predictions of the model and highlighted the important role of trust for
   a lasting procurement relationship under DW arrangement.
   Research limitations/implications Due to the lack of publicly available
   data and the challenges associated with the collection of primary field
   data, the sample is limited to 30 cattle producers and 5 processing
   firms.
   Originality/value This paper provides a theoretical and empirical
   platform for developing further research on coordination at the
   producer-processor interface of beef supply chain in Brazil and other
   countries with similar transaction characteristics. The findings will
   assist in designing more incentive compatible and self-enforcing
   arrangements between cattle farmers and slaughterhouses to enhance the
   product quality and the overall efficiency of the supply chain.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have found that wine cooperatives struggle to produce
   high quality grapes allowing them to produce better quality wines and to
   receive higher retail prices. In contrast, cooperatives in South Tyrol
   perform well and receive price premiums for wine quality relative to
   privately-owned local competitors. We identify the structural,
   organizational and social factors (i.e., elements of social capital)
   that may contribute to the economic success of a cooperative enterprise,
   surveying individual members of 13 wine cooperatives in South Tyrol.
   Relative payment per kg of grapes (pay-out) delivered measures the
   economic success of member growers. We propose that ``the strength of
   common vision among cooperative members{''} is an important element
   identifying the ``working social capital{''} of cooperatives and examine
   whether it depends on specific social and organizational variables such
   as commitment, trust or the strengths of personal relationships,
   participation in training activities and/or the presence of specific
   grape quality assessment criteria. Moreover, we examine if the pay-out
   or economic success of cooperative members can be explained by a set of
   structural variables and working social capital. We estimate two
   regression models to explain both the working social capital (i.e.,
   strength of a common vision among cooperative members), and pay-out or
   economic success that cooperative members receive for delivering grapes.
   Results indicate that specific social factors such as member commitment,
   trust, personal member-winemaker relations and gender as well as
   organizational factors (e.g., training activities, quality assessment
   criteria) help to explain working social capital while physical
   production capital (farm size), working social capital (common vision)
   and indicators of human capital (involvement, vineyard consulting) are
   important factors to explain the economic success of cooperative
   members.}},

Abstract = {{The organizational growth of farmer cooperatives is tied to increased
   heterogeneity in member attitudes and perceptions. To inform possible
   solutions, a better understanding of the complex interrelationships of
   member attitudes and perceptions is necessary. Using survey responses
   from 1,116 members of an organic marketing cooperative in the United
   States, this paper develops a structural equation model of six factors:
   organic lifestyle, mission support, participation, trust, satisfaction,
   and long-term commitment. The final model illustrates nine significant
   relationships, including satisfaction and long-term commitment. The
   result suggests the long-term survival or viability of farmer
   cooperatives is not only dependent on its financial performance but also
   the utility of its members. In terms of member attitudes and
   perceptions, trust and mission support may offer the best opportunities
   for farmer cooperatives to foster member satisfaction and thus address
   the negative consequences of heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Ethnocentrism, Trust, and the Willingness to Pay of Chinese Consumers
   for Organic Labels from Different Countries and Certifiers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Although numerous studies have examined consumer preference for organic
   foods, few have focused on consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for organic
   labels from dissimilar countries or certifiers. We conducted a choice
   experiment to examine how Chinese consumer ethnocentrism and trust on
   organic labels and certifiers may affect their WTP for organic labels
   from different countries as well as for different certifiers. Chinese
   consumers did not show a high level of ethnocentrism, and this may lead
   to inconsistencies in their WTP for organic labels. Significantly,
   consumer preferences for certifiers did not change remarkably with the
   increase in consumer ethnocentrism. Chinese consumers generally
   preferred organic labels from developed countries (or US-invested
   organic certifiers). With increases in the trust in labels, consumer WTP
   for each type of organic label increased in general, but the difference
   between WTPs for organic labels from different countries decreased.
   Similar results were observed in consumer WTP for certifiers.
   Determining distinct preferences for organic labels from various sources
   and countries can be a valuable reference for manufacturers or
   international certification service providers to choose target markets
   and for governments to establish their certification systems.}},

Abstract = {{After a series of shocking domestic food safety scandals in the past few
   years, environmental concerns have risen in the eyes of the public. The
   aim of this paper is to analyse the relationships among firm
   performance, customer capital, R\&D innovation, structural capital, firm
   asset, environmental turbulence, and the macroeconomy by using the panel
   data model on Taiwanese food industry firms during 2010-2016 and by
   examining the results of the multiple regime panel smooth transition
   regression (MR-PSTR) model. The findings show that environmental
   turbulence and the misery index have a negative relationship on firms'
   performance, while there is a positive relationship between customer
   capital and firm performance. However, under high environmental
   turbulence, customer capital and firm performance are negatively
   related, meaning that a firm's marketing promotion will be ineffective.
   This study recommends that the food industry establish a high degree of
   trust from society and consumers. It is also important for the food
   industry to establishes a positive attitude towards quality
   requirements.}},

   Using qualitative data of 24 members and quantitative data of 279

   mixed-method design to explore the impact of members' WeChat engagement
   on relational outcomes. The findings indicate that WeChat engagement
   positively affects four relational outcomes: Service satisfaction, word
   of mouth, social bonds, and commitment. In addition, those four
   relational outcomes are not equally influenced by WeChat engagement. The
   greatest impact is on commitment, while the lowest is on service
   satisfaction. Furthermore, multigroup analysis results suggest that
   gender moderates the relationship between WeChat engagement and

Abstract = {{Regarding the honey industry, market prices are strongly affected by the
   origin and composition of products. In particular, the adulteration of
   honey can be divided into cases of honey being mixed with artificial
   syrup, the different origin of the adulteration and the presence of cane
   sugar residue. Unfortunately, recent studies mentioned that most honey
   is mixed with artificial syrups. Thus, determining such unnaturally
   present sugar is necessary to maintain the trust of the consuming
   populations. To investigate the possibility of syrup augmentation, this
   study first clarifies two points of great importance. First, long-term
   feeding of cane sugar to honey bee colonies in winter and the continuous
   harvest of honey were investigated to evaluate the C-4 sugar ratio in
   spring through inspection of the C-13/C-12 isotopic ratio. As the
   results indicated, C-4 sugar was detected as ``sugar residue{''} in
   honey samples when the honey bee colonies were fed with cane sugar in
   winter and when the honey was collected in the first and second harvests
   in March. As indicated from the samples of 89 Taiwanese longan honeys,
   54 Thai longan honeys, and 20 Taiwanese non-longan honeys for analysis,
   such ``sugar residues{''} were in 40\% (8/20) of the Taiwanese
   non-longan honeys, 15\% (3/20) of 2017 Taiwanese longan honeys and 20\%
   (4/20) of 2017 Thai longan honeys; these samples were classified as
   adulterated honey (C-4\% > 7). Second, as revealed in the honeys'
   protein contents, statistically significant differences were found
   between Taiwanese (>1.00 mg/g) and Thai longan honeys (<1.00 mg/g).
   Apparently, this significant difference could be used to classify the
   difference in origins of longan honeys. This novel inspection of ``sugar
   residue{''} and ``origin{''} in honey could represent the first attempt
   for a protocol to guarantee both the quality and quantity assurance of
   honey in the marketplace. Copyright (C) 2018, Food and Drug

Abstract = {{European food law states that official checks on goods exchanged within
   the community should be performed at the place of origin, trusting in
   the guarantees provided by the supplier Member State. However, spot
   checks at the destination are also allowed. The Veterinary Offices for
   Compliance with EU Requirement (UVAC) are uniquely Italian offices
   implementing destination controls on EU products of animal origin. In
   this study, a data analysis on the control activity of the UVAC of
   Tuscany on seafood products in the period 2014-2016 was performed.
   Consignments were analysed according to their category (fish, fillets,
   crustaceans, molluscs, processed products) and country origin and data
   on seafood market flows were provided. Checks performed on consignments
   were investigated and cases of non-compliances with the EU standard
   safety requirements were analysed. Fish category was the most
   representative (49\%), followed by molluscs (24\%), fillets (12\%),
   crustaceans (8\%) and processed seafood (5\%) and consignments were
   mainly provided by Spain, France and Netherlands. These outcomes were
   relatively in accordance with national and European data. The percentage
   of checked consignments was higher than the national one, although
   decreasing (from 0.73\% in 2014 to 0.57\% in 2016). 26 consignments
   (3.4\% of the total checked) were found as non-compliant with the
   standard EU requirements: 12 (46.2\%) involved chemical risks (mercury,
   additives), 9 involved biological risks (L. monocytogenes, Anisakis
   spp., Norovirus), and 5 involved physical risks and other minor
   irregularities. These outcomes proved the actual usefulness of ancillary
   checks performed at national level in protecting consumers' health and
   even represents a further data source for evaluating EU citizens risk
   exposure.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Regulation of food systems exists to ensure safety and enhance consumer
   confidence in the food which they purchase and consume. However, some
   regulatory systems fail to instil public confidence. In China for
   example, trust in the domestic food system is low as a consequence of
   multiple high-profile food scandals, many of which linked to food fraud.
   Fraud occurs when food is intentionally adulterated for economic gain
   and may, but not always, pose a risk to the safety of food. Food
   authenticity and quality may also be compromised. The focus of this
   research relates to how Chinese consumers perceive food fraud and make
   choices in the absence of trust in regulatory systems. Seven focus
   groups with middle class Chinese participants in tier 1 and 2 cities
   (Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu) were conducted to explore attitudes of
   and perception towards food fraud. Infant milk formula, olive oil and
   Scotch whisky were used as prompts for attitudinal and perceptual
   elicitation. The findings indicated that Chinese consumers consider food
   fraud to represent a food hazard that poses a threat to the
   authenticity, quality and reliability of food and increased the risk of
   purchasing and consuming of unsafe food. Consumers were found to rely on
   informal kinship networks as trusted sources of information regarding
   food products' authenticity and safety. Behavioural responses included a
   range of risk relieving strategies to support food purchasing
   judgements, in the perceived absence of regulatory protection, that
   included: pre-purchase and consumption information seeking; the use of

Abstract = {{A series of food safety incidents has led to low levels of trust in the
   safety of domestically produced Chinese infant milk formula. Concerned
   parents in China increasingly source `foreign-produced' brands and use a
   range of authenticity cues as assurance of the safety and authenticity
   of infant formula products. However, the effectiveness of authenticity
   cues in providing assurance to Chinese consumers has not been evaluated.
   The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of various
   authenticity cues for infant milk product choices. Latent class models
   were used to analyse responses to an online choice experiment with 350
   consumers of European infant formula in three Chinese cities: Beijing,
   Guangzhou and Chengdu. The model included respondents' preferences for
   different labels, authenticity cues and price along with perceptions,
   attitudes, and socio-demographic characteristics. We identified two
   consumer segments, with one preferring lower priced infant formula and
   the second choosing higher priced products. All authenticity cues,
   including price, appear to serve as indicators of food quality and
   safety, and all were found to be highly important information sources
   for the respondents when making purchase decisions. In general, Chinese
   consumers are prepared to pay a premium for authenticity assurance.
   Chinese policy makers and the infant formula industry should continue to
   improve quality control systems to increase consumers' trust in food
   value chains. These control systems should comprise the whole food
   supply chain, from production to marketing, and should focus on building
   trust and communicating credibility.}},

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{242-249}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Prior research has revealed that flavors (sweetness) may metaphorically
   influence social judgements and behaviors (interpersonal `sweetness').
   Given the inherently social nature of eating, other food related sensory
   signals beyond flavor may be conceptually mapped to social cognition and
   behavior. Here we tested the hypothesis that oral processing of foods
   with soft (vs. hard) textures may metaphorically facilitate (vs.
   inhibit) social behaviors conceptually associated with `tenderness' or
   `soft-heartedness'. Two studies examined the influence of imagined
   (Study 1) and actual (Study 2) oral processing of soft (vs. hard foods)
   on prosocial tendencies. Study 1 revealed that greater magnitude of
   sensory characteristics associated with imagined consumption of a hard
   food (i.e., dryness) was predictive of decreased interpersonal trust.
   Using actual food consumption in an interpersonal context, Study 2
   demonstrated increased interpersonal trust and charitable donation of
   time after oral processing of soft (vs. hard) food and suggested that
   this effect is a result of enhanced trust following consumption of soft
   food rather than suppression of trust following consumption of hard
   food. Although effects were modest, these findings provide initial
   suggestions that orosensory metaphors that shape social cognition are
   not limited to flavors (e.g., sweetness, spiciness), and that diverse
   properties of food may influence patterns of sociality.}},

Abstract = {{Imperfect competition in the food supply chain is a concern for several
   ``weak agents{''} such as small farmers and consumers. Given the
   difficulties in applying standard anti-trust regulations in the
   agri-food system, a growing interest is emerging in a decentralized
   approach where private entities, such as Producer Organizations (PO),
   are given active role in the governance of the agricultural markets. We
   present a simple bargaining model assessing the POs' capacity to
   rebalance bargaining power along the supply chain.
   The results show that POs can benefit farmers by strengthening their
   negotiation power, improving their bargaining position and worsening the
   buyer's one. Imposing a minimum size for POs may improve their
   effectiveness in affecting the buyer `s bargaining position. Such
   requirement should be calibrated on the structure of the downstream
   (upstream) relevant market.}},

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to analyse and testempirically the relationship between
   household agricultural production and crop diversity on child
   nutritional status in rural Myanmar, using data from the nationally
   representative 2013 Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT)
   survey. We are interested in analysing if higher agriculture production
   and greater crop diversity in the household translates into better
   nutritional status among children, measured using the three
   anthropometric measures height-for-age, weight-for-height and
   weight-for-age. The primary unit of analysis was the individual child
   aged between 7 and 60months for whom complete information was available
   for all our variables of interest. We estimated a series of regression
   models to explain stunting, wasting and underweight outcomes among 1037
   children aged 7-60months. Our results show that: (i) 37\% of the
   children in our sample were stunted, with stunting more prevalent among
   older children (aged 31-60months), (ii) children from households where
   agriculture was the main income source had a lower probability of being
   wasted, and (iii) there was no statistically significant relationship
   between crop harvest size and child nutrition outcomes among agriculture
   households. Our results clearly suggest that agricultural own-production
   is important as a food safety net, mitigating acute malnutrition, but
   this fades away for non-acute measures, reiterating its relative
   unimportance in terms of the livelihood drivers of child nutrition
   outcomes.}},

Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},

Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{67-81}},

Abstract = {{We study the role of trust, risk and time preferences for fanners'
   contract choices in a discrete choice experiment among Ghanaian
   pineapple farmers. We find that experimental measures of trust, risk and
   time preferences can predict preferences for contract attributes.
   Especially trust has economically important negative effects on the
   willingness to pay for high transparency in quality controls.
   Differences in preferences for timing of payment and timing of agreement
   making are partly explained by trust preferences and partly by time
   preferences. The importance of risk-sharing in form of lower quality
   grades accepted by the buyer increases with farmers' risk aversion,
   while risk preferences do not seem to be related to the timing of
   agreement making. Our results indicate that preferences affect farmers'
   participation constraints and argue that a diversification of contract
   offers might increase the willingness of farmers to participate in
   contract farming. This has implications for companies who aim at
   developing stable long-term relationships with farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Sellers' responses to online negative consumer reviews (NCRs) have a
   marked effect on consumer purchasing intentions. In this study, we
   divide seller's responses to NCRs into two categories: rational
   responses and emotional responses. Through two separate studies, we
   examine the impact of sellers' responses to online NCRs on consumer
   purchasing intention. Results reveal that product-related NCRs reduce
   consumer purchasing intentions more than service-related NCRs and having
   no reaction to NCRs from the sellers decreases consumer purchasing
   intentions. In addition, consumer trust mediates the relationship
   between seller's response to online NCRs and consumer purchasing
   intentions. The results also show that the impact on consumer purchasing
   intentions can be modified by the type of NCRs and sellers' responses.
   In particular, rational responses will be more effective for
   product-related NCRs, and for service-related NCRs, there does not
   appear to exist a significant difference between the effects of rational
   and emotional responses.}},

   through policy reforms and practical action. An important and novel part
   of the description of a SES, as developed under the PEGASUS project, is
   the assessment of its `valorisation cascade'. Through the mapping and
   consideration of assets, actors, interactions, drivers and the nature of
   the valorisation cascade in 34 diverse case studies, the project
   highlighted the importance of multi-actor approaches and social
   processes to foster beneficial change. These include collective action,
   co-learning and trust between actors, promoting experimentation and
   innovation, developing public and/or consumer awareness and identifying
   new valorisation options, including via commercial supply chains and

Abstract = {{More environmentally sensitive management of farmland and forestry is
   needed in Europe in response to increasing public demand and to meet the
   requirements of EU legislation for example on biodiversity. However, the
   provision of environmental and social public goods from farmland and
   forestry is not increasing at the required pace. A step change in
   approach is required: the opportunity could be provided by the current
   debate on adopting a more performance focussed model of the Common
   Agricultural Policy. Current policy mechanisms, including regulation and
   a range of incentives to individual farmers, meet part of the need but
   are not sufficient. Detailed analysis of 34 cases across the EU has
   convinced us that a new approach based on greater engagement with a
   wider range of key actors through collective actions could have greater
   ambition. It could aim for greater scale, longevity and coherence of
   action across a territory or along a supply chain. Building trust and
   establishing the right form of governance for highly diverse networks
   and types of cooperation is vital. Commercial actors in the supply chain
   could play a larger role. Links between flexible and extended forms of
   policy support, including for new initiatives, multi-stakeholder
   partnerships and projects and for facilitators, will be needed.}},

Abstract = {{The growth in country of origin (COO) food labelling is part of the
   ongoing proliferation of information provided to consumers. However, the
   implementation of COO labelling means that consumers can sometimes end
   up more confused than informed. This concern raises questions regarding
   how COO information should be provided, along with what information
   needs to be given to consumers. We begin by discussing what COO actually
   indicates. This is followed by a review of the evidence on consumer use
   of COO information. Then turning to current policy issues, we draw
   attention to how COO information can be used to promote consumer
   ethnocentrism as well as inadvertently causing trade tensions both
   between trading countries and within the EU single market. We then
   consider how developments in information technology like blockchains or
   smart labels might change how COO information is collated and used. In
   particular, we observe that any increase in the use of this technology
   will depend on whether or not consumers trust these new digital sources
   of information. Potentially, the convenience with which COO information
   could be verified by consumers using information technology is a logical
   development given consumer demands for convenience in general.}},

Title = {{Rethinking inspection in slaughterhouses: Opportunities and challenges
   arising from a shared risk management system in poultry slaughterhouses}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{48-55}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Health surveillance systems are increasingly managed in a cooperative
   way, involving several stake-holders sharing tasks. In France,
   specially-trained poultry slaughterhouse staff are allowed to
   participate in the tasks of official auxiliaries under the supervision
   and responsibility of Official Veterinary Services (OVS), on the basis
   of a risk analysis. To properly organise interactions between
   stakeholders in this multi -stakeholder risk management, the current
   control system is based on alerts from Food Business Operators (FBOs) to
   OVS. A field study was conducted in order to describe the ways alerts
   are raised in practice, to identify the impact of this method on work
   organisation and communication, and highlight the opportunities it may
   offer. Thirty poultry slaughterhouses were surveyed through
   semi-directive interviews held separately with the official
   veterinarian/auxiliary and/or the quality manager/assistant. The
   interviews were qualitatively analysed. A wide range of modus operandi -
   both for control task division and communication tools - was observed in
   the field depending on slaughterhouse organisation, the alert's severity
   or the quality of the relationships between stakeholders. Internal
   alert-raising procedures were implemented in all cases. This
   surveillance system was considered efficient as long as the work
   organisation was clearly described, i.e. the organisation of positions,
   definition of missions and roles, and implementation of specific
   procedures for information exchange and training programmes. The pivotal
   challenges entailed limiting the administrative burden and building
   trusting relationships. In conclusion, this innovative system appears
   relevant due to tailored alert criteria, pre-implementation preparations
   and system formalisation, and cooperation between stakeholders. It also
   offers the OVS an opportunity to reaffirm their central position in
   risk-based meat inspection. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{How consumer confidence in food safety practices along the food supply
   chain determines food handling practices: Evidence from Ghana}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{265-273}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between consumer confidence in food safety measures for
   vegetables sold in open markets and their use of safe food handling
   practices in the domestic environment was investigated for a set of 332
   randomly sampled vegetable consumers within the suburbs of Accra, Ghana.
   More specifically, the confidence of consumers in twelve food safety
   measures employed by farmers, middlemen and traders was assessed,
   together with the frequency of treatment of vegetables with salt or
   vinegar and whether or not vegetables were stored in a hygienic and
   ventilated place. The results suggest that the level of consumer
   confidence in food safety measures along the value chain of vegetable
   production influences their food safety actions. Principal component
   analysis identified two factors determining confidence: (a) cleanliness
   and contact exposure, and (b) safe practices related to water,
   pesticides and fertilisers in production and general hygiene at the
   selling point. Structural equation modelling showed that confidence was
   significantly related to the cleanliness and contact exposure component
   (path coefficient = 0.41, p = 0.002), but only indirectly to the safe
   production practices and hygiene component (r = 0.71). Moreover,
   confidence then directed storage (path coefficient = 0.54, p < 0.001),
   but impaired use of salt or vinegar (path coefficient = -0.29, p =
   0.0015). Furthermore, multinomial logit modelling revealed a significant
   association between delayed vegetable consumption and frequency of
   treatment of vegetables with salt or vinegar before cooking or eating
   (chi(2) = 13.2, p < 0.05). It also showed that the marginal effects of
   changes in the two principal components of confidence operated
   differently for groups of consumers who differed in their combined use
   of storage and treatment. These findings have implications for food risk
   communication and actions to improve local conditions under which food
   is sold.}},

Abstract = {{Traceability information is a solution to communicate safety practices,
   increasing consumer's trust. This study aims to analyse traceability
   elements used in products and their impact in trust in Brazil. In the
   first phase, 4577 food products of two supermarkets were analysed.
   Results show that traceability information is practically unexplored:
   only 1.07\% of the food products presents traceability information,
   indicating in most cases the name of the producer. The second phase was
   a survey that analysed attitudes of 631 consumers towards traceability.
   It is possible to affirm that disease/pest and inputs traceability are
   the elements that increase consumers' trust in food safety. Using the
   IRT model, process and inputs traceability are the most relevant
   elements in the traceability system. These results have implications on
   traceability systems perfomance improvement in Brazil, since companies
   should focus on these elements to improve their food systems and meet
   consumers' expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic modification (GM) of crops provides a methodology for the
   agricultural improvements needed to deliver global food security.
   However, public opposition to GM-food is great. The debate has tended to
   risk communication, but here we show through study of a large nationally
   representative sample of British adults that public acceptance of
   GM-food has social, cultural and affective contexts. Regression models
   showed that metaphysical beliefs about the sanctity of food and an
   emotional dislike of GM-food were primary negative determinants, while
   belief in the value of science and favourable evaluation of the
   benefits-to-risks of GM-food were secondary positive determinants.
   Although institutional trust, general knowledge of the GM-food debate
   and belief in the eco-friendliness of GM-food were all associated with
   acceptance, their influence was minor. While a belief in the sanctity of
   food had a direct inverse effect on GM acceptance, belief in the value
   of science was largely mediated through favourable perception of
   benefits-to-risks. Furthermore, segmentation analysis demonstrated that
   anxiety about GM-food had social and cultural antecedents, with white
   men being least anxious and older vegetarian women being most anxious.
   Rational argument alone about the risks and benefits of GM-food is
   unlikely to change public perceptions of GM-technology.}},

Abstract = {{The consumption of even small amounts of animal-source foods has the
   potential to improve nutrition, especially in vulnerable households.
   However, scaling up their production bears food safety risks that are
   often overlooked due to a disconnect between human nutrition and animal
   sciences. The aim of this scoping study in Tanzania was to identify
   opportunities for nutritional and food safety benefits from cow milk.
   Questionnaires were administered to 156 producers and 157 consumers in
   10 villages in Lushoto and Mvomero districts. Farmers reported that
   veterinary medicines such as oxytetracyclines, penicillin and
   streptomycin were frequently given to cattle, and a majority did not
   discard milk during or after treatment. Less than half of the producers
   boiled milk, although sale of fermented milk, made by spontaneous
   fermentation of raw milk, was common. Cattle management was
   characterised by low levels of biosecurity, hygienic practices and
   disease control. A majority of consumers reported not to have enough
   food to meet their family needs. The Food Consumption Score was
   acceptable for all households, but significantly higher for households
   with dairy cattle. When making purchasing decisions, the appearance of
   milk and trust in the supplier were more important considerations than
   hygiene practices observed. A total of 26\% of consumers reported to
   consume raw milk ``usually{''} or ``sometimes{''} and 54\% of consumers
   reported to drink fermented milk ``usually{''} or ``sometimes{''}.
   Consumers had a positive attitude towards milk and concern for quality
   but most thought there was no risk of illness from milk consumption.
   The findings promote understanding of the complexity surrounding the
   local food environment and practices related to the production and
   consumption of dairy products and allow shaping recommendations for
   nutritionsensitive livestock interventions.}},

Abstract = {{This address explores the communication challenges facing the economics
   profession and agri-food and rural economists in particular against a
   background of reputational damage to the profession and an apparent loss
   of trust in experts. It argues that a common thread linking many of the
   challenges is the need for more effective models of communication so
   that our economic concepts, ideas and research findings can be more
   timely, better understood and, most importantly, have greater impact.
   Five important challenges are examined: loss of trust in experts;
   emotions and decision making; the role of the media; the roles of
   agri-food and rural economists; and competition from other disciplines
   and interests. A good practice communications framework is then proposed
   embodying ten important communication principles: understanding the
   target audience; understanding the political context of decision makers;
   generating a robust evidence base; building reputation and credibility;
   need for cross disciplinary working; consulting with stakeholder groups;
   getting the timing right; producing high quality presentations; making
   use of social media; and being prepared for challenges. Four
   stereotypical categories of communication incorporating different
   standards of rigour and relevance are identified: Ivory tower; Gold
   Standard; Populist; and Quicksand. Responses by the Agricultural
   Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural
   Economists to the need for more accessible communications via the
   development of the innovative outreach journal EuroChoices are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, traceability labels with a quick response (QR) code have been
   printed on product packaging to help consumers easily access
   traceability information through their smart phones. We analyzed
   consumer (n = 616) attitudes and purchase intentions towards traceable
   minced beef/beef steak in England, and identified psychosocial
   determinants of their purchase using the theory of planned behavior
   (TPB). Respondents held a general favorable attitude with positive
   behavioral beliefs and high trust towards the traceable product. In the
   TPB model, attitude was the main determinant of intention to purchase
   each traceable product, followed by subjective norm and perceived
   behavioral control (PBC). The predictive power of the TPB model
   increased marginally for each sub-group when it was extended with
   habits, trust, and frequency of purchase. In the TPB-extended minced
   beef model, PBC was no longer a significant driver, and trust replaced
   subjective norm as the second most important predictor. In the
   TPBextended beef steak model, attitude, subjective norm and PBC were all
   still significant drivers of intention, however, in order of importance,
   production process habits and origin habits were more important than
   PBC. These findings have importance for those involved in the production
   and marketing of beef. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{European consumer healthiness evaluation of Tree-from' labelled food
   products}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{377-388}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study aimed to find out how ``free-from labelling{''} shapes
   consumers' perception of food products and whether the absence of an
   ingredient is considered an indicator of improved nutritional value of
   the product. An online survey was conducted in four European countries:
   the United Kingdom, Sweden, Poland, and France (overall N = 1950). Four
   ``free-from labels{''} (lactose-free, gluten-free, GMO-free, and palm
   oil-free) were tested using different product categories that these
   labels typically appear on. Healthiness perception was evaluated by
   comparing products with the free-from labels to identical products
   without the labels. Potential predictors for healthiness evaluation and
   intention to pay a price premium were assessed, including nutrition
   knowledge, information-seeking on food packages, preference for food
   naturalness, general health interest, trust in actors in the food
   domain, and affect regarding the absent ingredients. Products with a
   free-from label were considered healthier than products without such a
   label, with the strongest effects occurring for labels indicating that
   products were free of GMOs and free of palm oil. Some differences were
   observed among countries in the evaluation of the product-label
   combinations. Information-seeking, nutrition knowledge, and affect were
   significant predictors of healthiness evaluation. Furthermore,
   healthiness evaluation, information-seeking, nutrition knowledge, and
   preference for naturalness predicted intention to pay a price premium
   for products labelled free-from. When shaping consumers' food shopping
   behaviour using certain food labels, it is important to know how
   consumers interpret those labels. A false interpretation of labels might
   lead to unintended changes in consumer behaviour.}},

Title = {{Exploration of gender differences in bottled mineral water consumption:
   A projective study of consumer's perception in Brazil}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The bottled mineral water sector is strategic to countries like Brazil
   and understanding the factors that guides the purchase and consumption
   by men and women becomes vital to the product's commercial success. In
   this context, projective techniques are important tools to comprehend
   the consumers' perception and to the development of target strategies of
   marketing. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the
   gender differences about the bottled mineral water's perception through
   using Word Association (WA) alongside with the Partial Least
   Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The results demonstrated that
   from the 12 listed categories for the product, the most common were:
   ``necessity,{''} ``well-being,{''} ``quality,{''} and ``appearance,{''}
   and it was possible to identify through PLS-DA the main differences
   (p<.05) between genders. The bottled mineral water consumption by the
   female public is possibly directed to necessity and well-being, despite
   practicality, while the male public made the purchase and consumption of
   the product associated to brand and informal places. Yet, it was
   realized that the product's presentation and quality parameter were
   highly impactful in the consumers' attitudes from both sexes. It is
   highlighted that the WA and PLS-DA tools, used together in an innovative
   way, contribute to the deep acknowledgment about the bottled mineral
   water's consumption, and their application can be expanded and adopted
   routinely in marketing research and in the new marketing strategies.
   Practical applications
   This study brings relevant information about the factors which should be
   considered by consumers at the moment of purchase and consumption of
   bottled water, emphasizing the differences by gender, with the advantage
   of the results being obtained using simple sensory methodologies, as the
   Word association task which taken in account the consumers' perception
   and evaluated for multivariate approaches, as Partial Least
   Squares-Discrimination Analysis. These findings should be considered to
   bottled water industry to elaborate marketing messages to increase their
   sales in an effective way.}},

   experimental auctions in Vietnam}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{283-296}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the value of sustainably-produced rice and
   incentive mechanisms for the adoption of sustainable production
   standards throughout rice value chains in Southeast Asia. This study
   tests the feasibility of a market-based incentive mechanism by eliciting
   consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice produced and labeled under
   a national sustainable production standard in the South of Vietnam
   through experimental auctions. Domestic consumers are willing to pay a
   9\% price premium for certified sustainably-produced rice. This premium
   gradually increases up to 33\% when incremental levels of information on
   certification and traceability are provided. Consumers willing to pay
   premiums for sustainably-produced rice are more health-conscious, have
   better knowledge of and greater trust in food quality certification for
   rice, and tend to be more environmentally conscious and to read food
   labels before purchasing. Findings suggest that sustainable production
   labels for rice should be accompanied by supplementary information on
   certification and traceability to increase consumers' awareness and
   appreciation of sustainably-produced rice. Promoting certified
   sustainably-produced rice hence crucially hinges on strengthening
   consumers' knowledge of and trust in food quality certification.
   Communication strategies are recommended to focus on the environmental
   and health benefits of sustainably-produced rice.}},

Title = {{The influence of front-of-package nutrition claims on food perceptions
   and purchase intentions among Nepali consumers}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is increasing in countries undergoing nutrition transition
   (e.g., Nepal) largely due to changing food environments. Food choices
   are influenced by marketing and packaging, including front-of-pack
   nutrition claims (FOPNCs). Although FOPNCs can help consumers identify
   healthful foods, these claims can also lead consumers to unduly
   attribute healthfulness to unhealthful food products. This study
   investigated the effects of FOPNCs on consumers' purchase intentions and
   product perceptions of snack foods. Participants were 239 adult shoppers
   in Kathmandu, Nepal. Participants viewing product images rated purchase
   intentions and seven product perceptions (e.g., healthfulness,
   tastiness). Participants reported their two most important shopping
   priorities, and explained why they found a specific FOPNC to be
   truthful/influential or not. Path analyses of multiple mediation models
   showed that FOPNCs most often influenced the product perception of
   healthful for children, while product perceptions of tasty and adults
   like it were most predictive of purchase intention. Inductive thematic
   analysis of open-ended responses identified various reasons for trust
   and skepticism in FOPNCs. FOPNCs were largely described as useful,
   despite their inconsistent influence on perceptions. Thematic analysis
   of shopping priorities resulted in 10 themes; the three most prevalent
   were quality, familiarity, and taste. Only 12\% of reported shopping
   priorities appeared to motivate the use of FOPNCs (i.e., health and
   nutrition and package labeling). Evidence that FOPNCs create health
   halos for snack foods did emerge. However, FOPNCs' inconsistent or
   absent impact on most product perceptions and purchase intentions
   suggest that FOPNCs are not a primary contributor to increasing obesity
   during Nepal's nutrition transition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates UK consumers' trust in sixteen information

   model show considerable heterogeneity in consumers' perceptions of trust
   and choice variability, The findings from this study provide insights
   into the development of best practices and policies in risk
   communication and management for novel foods produced by
   nanotechnologies. More specifically, they highlight how targeted
   approaches can be used by policymakers responsible for disseminating

Journal = {{CURRENT RESEARCH IN NUTRITION AND FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-69}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{One of the challenges faced by healthcare professionals working with
   individuals seeking to lose weight is the issue of adherence.
   Individuals often fail to stick to long term dietary changes, which can
   impact on weight loss success. The aim of this study is to identify
   factors which influence adherence to nutritional intervention for weight
   loss, from the experiences of a purposively sampled group of individuals
   who had successful weight loss outcomes whilst working with a
   nutritional practitioner. Four participants who met the inclusion
   criteria took part in a semi-structured interview. They were asked to
   discuss their experiences of working with a nutritional practitioner,
   their motivation for seeking nutritional support, their experiences of
   working with the practitioner and the subsequent nutritional
   intervention and what they believed encouraged them to adhere to the
   intervention in the longer term. The interviews were audio-recorded,
   transcribed and analysed for themes using Interpretative
   Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Nine themes were identified within the
   four transcripts. The themes were grouped and labelled as follows; (1)
   professional (what they do and what they know), (2) in-depth and
   thorough, (3) can't argue with the results, (4) someone genuinely cares,
   (5) I am an important part of this process, (6) empowered by knowledge,
   (7) shift in focus towards health, (8) my motivation, and (9) this is
   who I am and what I need to do. These themes were then grouped into
   three superordinate themes; I trust this process, I feel valued, and
   understanding of self. The findings suggest practitioners may have
   opportunities to influence adherence to nutritional interventions for
   weight loss. These opportunities can be grouped into four categories,
   which are: enhancing professionalism, enhancing their relationship with
   the client, providing coaching and providing education.}},

Abstract = {{The commercial application of transgenic technology in the food industry
   has become a crucial topic worldwide. This study aims to achieve the
   following objectives: (i) to examine consumers' purchase intention
   toward genetically modified (GM) food by using benefit-risk analysis
   (BRA); (ii) to examine consumers' purchase intention toward GM food
   based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB); and (iii) to determine
   which framework or theory significantly influences the interpretation of
   purchase intention toward GM food under an integrated framework
   incorporating the BRA and the TPB. An online survey was conducted among
   408 qualified samples who were analysed through structural equation
   modeling. The result analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i)
   under the BRA framework, Chinese consumers rely on their positive
   attitude toward GM food to increase purchase intention and their
   perceived risks to decrease purchase intention. Moreover, consumers'
   trust increases their perceived benefits offered by GM food and decrease
   their perceived risks; (ii) under the TPB framework, attitude toward GM
   technology is the most significant predictor of purchase intention
   toward GM food, followed by perceived behavioral control and subjective
   norms; and (iii) under the integrated framework, although most of the
   results in the single framework of the BRA or the TPB are supported, the
   BRA provides better interpretation than the TPB. In addition, several
   mediating effects are found in the context of purchase intention toward
   GM food.}},

Abstract = {{The food consumer plays an increasingly prominent role in shaping the
   food and farming system. A better understanding of how public policies
   affect consumer choice and how those choices impact health, environment,

   dietary-related diseases and the efficacy of policies designed to
   improve dietary choices, trust in the food system, acceptance of new
   food and farm technologies, environmental impacts of food consumption,
   preferences for increased food quality, and issues related to food
   safety. We also identify some research challenges and barriers that
   exist when studying these issues, including data quality and
   availability, uncertainty in the underlying biological and physical
   sciences, and the challenges to welfare economics that are presented by
   behavioral economics. We also identify the unique role that economists
   can play in helping address these key societal challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Sea buckthorn (Hippophae), an ancient crop with modern virtues, is
   increasingly consumed in source of foods and nutraceuticals. The growing
   demand leads to the adulteration of commercial sea buckthorn products,
   which is a common form of food fraud. Herein, a high resolution melting
   assay, targeting a DNA barcoding region of the internal transcribed
   spacer 2 (ITS2) (Bar-HRM) was developed to identify the seven native
   Chinese Hippophae species, and to authenticate commercial sea buckthorn
   products. Melting data from the HRM assay demonstrated that all
   Hippophae species could be clearly distinguished. Then, application to
   commercial sea buckthorn products indicated the existence of adulterants
   or contamination, further confirmed using Sanger sequencing results for
   PCR products from HRM. The Bar-HRM technique proposed in this work could
   provide a method for regulatory agencies, promoting consumers trust, and
   raise the quality and safety of sea buckthorn products.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A high demand for seafood in combination with overfishing threatens
   living marine resources worldwide. Sound regulation and enforcement is
   needed for sustainable management, yet the seafood business is
   characterized by high levels of uncertainty regarding product identity.
   Here, 280 fish dishes sold in commercial restaurants, canteens of the
   European Union and sushi bars throughout Brussels, Belgium were assessed
   for mislabeling using DNA barcoding. Overall 31.1\% mislabeled samples
   were detected, with mislabeling present in all types of vendors. Cod and
   sole were the most frequently sampled and were also mislabeled regularly
   (13.1\% and 11.1\%). Bluefin tuna was substituted almost always (95\%
   mislabeling), mostly by other tuna species. Results show that seafood
   labeling rules and controls are not sufficient, particularly in the food
   service industry, where for example commercial denominations can be
   ambiguous and scientific species denomination is not compulsory.
   Irrespective if negligent or fraudulent, mislabeling practices are
   detrimental for economical and sustainability goals and also consumers'
   trust. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   risk also have mixed effects on consumers' risk perceptions across the

Abstract = {{Despite the USDA's genetically modified (GM) regulatory approval
   process, many U.S. consumers still want GM foods labeled. Therefore,
   this research identifies how individuals' trust in the ability of

   demographics affects their desire for GM foods to be labeled. A survey
   was administered to 566 consumers to elicit their desire for GM labeling
   of sugar and sugar in soft drinks. Results of a bivariate ordered probit
   model suggest that less conscientious individuals, males, and
   individuals who have a greater trust in food manufacturers and the
   government to ensure the safety of food are less likely to desire GM
   labeling. Cluster analysis further identified market segments of
   individuals based on their level of desire for GM labeling. Results are
   informative to policy makers and GM technology participants.}},

Abstract = {{The federal state Baden-Wuerttemberg (Germany) has initiated a unique

   production, to disclose potential consumer fraud, to strengthen the
   consumer trust regarding the quality of organic seeds by establishing an
   effective control system and to pool data of pesticide residues in
   seeds. Between the year 2010 and 2014, 308 seed samples were analyzed
   (205 organic, 103 conventional). 114 samples (50 organic, 64
   conventional) showed pesticide residues with a content of >= 0.010 mg/kg
   - mostly fungicides or insecticides. In some cases, the labelling
   ``organic{''} of the concerned seed lot was prohibited due to our

Abstract = {{To better understand the success and the growing number of Short Food
   Supply Chains in Italy, this study investigates consumer motivations and
   behaviours with regard to these alternative agri-food networks through
   an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). In
   particular, the paper focuses on the role of consumer trust towards,
   purchasing at short chains, as well as the role of consumer rural
   residence and fair-trade purchasing preference, in addition to common
   TPB variables. To this purpose, an online survey was conducted on a
   convenience sample of 260 consumers in Italy. Structural equation
   modelling confirmed the role of trust as a direct antecedent of consumer
   intention to purchase food at short chains, as well as the
   best-supported attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural
   control in the standard TPB model. The investigation found that consumer
   rural residence and fair-trade purchasing habits, in addition to
   intention and perceived behavioural control, influenced the behaviour.
   This evidence is interesting in order to suggest further marketing
   strategies for farmers in the direction of more ethical and
   trust-related forms of consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Computational models have earned broad acceptance for assessing chemical
   toxicity during early stages of drug discovery or environmental safety
   assessment. The majority of publicly available QSAR toxicity models have
   been developed for datasets including mostly drugs or drug -like
   compounds. We have evaluated and compared chemical spaces occupied by
   cosmetics, drugs, and pesticides, and explored whether current
   computational models of toxicity endpoints can be universally applied to
   all these chemicals. Our analysis of the chemical space overlap and
   applicability domain (AD) of models built previously for twenty
   different toxicity endpoints showed that most of these models afforded
   high coverage (>90\%) for all three classes of compounds analyzed
   herein. Only T. pyriformis models demonstrated lower coverage for drugs
   and pesticides (38\% and 54\%, respectively). These results show that,
   for the most part, historical QSAR models built with data available for
   different toxicity endpoints can be used for toxicity assessment of
   novel chemicals irrespective of the intended commercial use; however,
   the AD restriction is necessary to assure the expected prediction
   accuracy. Local models may need to be developed to capture chemicals
   that appear as outliers with respect to global models. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The economic incentives facing people making decisions about infectious
   disease control have been given due theoretical consideration in the
   literature, based on principles of economic rationality. Such deductive
   models provide important tools for generating hypotheses. However, the
   application of such models in a predictive capacity has been criticised.
   Simultaneously, empirical studies aimed at quantitative exploration of
   farmer behaviour have relied heavily on social cognitive models, such as
   the theory of planned behaviour, without exploration of the
   epidemiological consequences of variability in behaviour within
   populations. Advances in other social sciences have revealed systematic
   biases in human reasoning which cast doubt on the validity of the
   rational economic model as a generalisation of human decision making. We
   review the characteristics of infectious disease and disease-control
   interventions and the potential for bias in implementation decision
   making at primary producer level. Specific focus is given to the
   generation of externalities, both positive and negative; the perception
   of risk, relating to disease incidence, technology adoption and time
   preference; and finally uncertainty, and its potential to be moderated
   by trust in information sources. This information is then used to
   summarise supplemental psychological constructs which taken holistically
   may strengthen our ability to quantitatively explore human behaviour in
   this complex decision-making environment.}},

Abstract = {{The article considers theoretical aspects of the mechanisms of land
   resources management in Ukraine. The work determines main
   characteristics of land resources management and outlines the notion of
   land resources management of territorial communities under conditions of
   power decentralization. In the context, land resources management is
   currently viewed as important theoretical and methodological problem at
   different levels of power. The research concerns the main reasons for
   impossibility of established territorial communities to have lands at
   their disposal. Implementation of the state land policy expects from the
   bodies of state power working in the field of land relations, focused on
   rational use and protection of land, security of food safety of the
   country and creation of ecologically safe conditions for running of
   economic activity and living of people. Transition of lands to the
   control of amalgamated territorial communities is a common European
   practice of decentralization of rights and responsibilities. In terms of
   decentralization, the principal goal of the land reform is to secure
   sustainable social and economic development of the territories due to
   efficient management in the field of land use. Among the primary steps
   are the following, particularly the necessity to regulate the order
   concerning setting the boundaries of the area of amalgamated territorial
   communities and simplification of the procedure of development and
   approval of the documents concerning land organization in terms of
   determination of boundaries of administrative and territorial units. In
   Ukraine, there is no a legally approved general strategy of land
   resources and land relations development. Nevertheless, people have
   great expectations that they soon get the needed legislative documents,
   supporting adequate solution of the problems in the field of land
   relations, improving degree of trust of business people and society to
   the system of land relations.}},

Title = {{Why public dismissal of nutrition science makes sense: Post-truth,
   public accountability and dietary credibility}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1953-1964}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to critically engage with societal
   origins of public (dis)trust and public credibility of nutrition science
   and offer suggestions for addressing its public dismissal.
   Design/methodology/approach This viewpoint presents a conceptual
   analysis of public dismissal of nutrition science, drawing together
   perspectives on the relationships between science and society from the
   history, sociology and philosophy of science.
   Findings The origin of trust amongst scientists relies is actively tied
   to their social and moral status and science as a cultural activity is
   inextricably linked to institutions of power. Accordingly, trust in
   science relies heavily on public perceptions of those institutions, the
   ways in which citizens feel represented by them, and to what extent
   citizens consider these institutions to be held accountable. Ignoring
   this origin leads to expectations of science and scientists they cannot
   live up to and inevitable disappointment in those holding such
   expectations.
   Social implications Managing responsible expectations asks that we first
   dismiss dominant portrayals of science as pure, neutral, value-free and
   fuelled by curiosity. Second, we should pursue a reorganisation of
   science, favouring social inclusiveness over scientific exceptionalism.
   Originality/value Post-truth dynamics are a source of concern in the
   dissemination of nutrition science. Rather than dismissing it as a
   consequence of public ignorance, a comprehensive engagement with
   post-truth arguments allows a constructive repositioning of nutrition
   science organisation and communication. It asks that we design research
   programmes and studies differently, incorporate different voices. Above
   all else, it asks humility of researchers and tolerant approaches to
   other perspectives.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2066-2079}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate meat traceability by
   outlining the different perspectives and opinions of meat supply chain
   stakeholders (SCSs); it also evaluates potential of acceptance of
   blockchain technology (BCT) as a viable transparency and traceability
   system (TTS).
   Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey of 141 consumers
   reveals their opinions about TTSs. In addition, semi-structured
   interviews with seven retail managers, four government officials and one
   blockchain service provider (Project Provenance Ltd) provide expert
   insights.
   Findings The results demonstrate that consumers are overwhelmed by the
   amount and complexity of certification labels. As a TTS, BCT
   implementation appears to have significant positive influences on
   consumers' purchasing decisions, mediated by consumers' quality
   perceptions. This study reveals the discordant perspectives of different
   stakeholders with regard to the importance of a BCT-based TTS.
   Originality/value This study investigates current TTSs and certification
   labels, and probes customer perception of a potential BCT-based solution
   for meat traceability. Changes to supply chains' mentality and the
   active establishment of trust in BCT applications are needed. Firms
   should take both holistic and altruistic views to deal with the
   challenges of TTSs in the meat supply chain. The adoption of BCT, in
   combination with DNA coding, seems promising as a solution to many of
   the issues that currently plague TTSs.}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2539-2553}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to obtain insights into Vietnamese
   consumers' knowledge and relevance of as well as their reaction to
   modern food retailers (MFRs) responsible and irresponsible conduct.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from an online survey
   applying content analysis, uni- and multivariate tests and multivariate
   regression models.
   Findings In total, 60 percent of respondents are not aware of
   (ir)responsible conduct of MFR. Most of those aware of such behavior
   indicate that this has induced a change in their shopping behavior. This
   holds to a similar extent for those not aware but envisaging the
   (ir)responsible conduct of MFRs. The findings point to a negativity bias
   in that consumers' reaction is more sensitive regarding irresponsible
   than responsible firm behavior. This bias is higher for consumers
   already knowledgeable about the (ir)responsible behavior of MFRs. The
   likelihood that consumers punish irresponsible conduct is influenced by
   the importance they attach to food quality and safety while those having
   high concerns for environmental, social and ethical' issues are more
   likely to reward responsible firm actions.
   Research limitations/implications The negativity bias which implies that
   consumers react more sensitive regarding irresponsible than responsible
   firm behavior is likely underestimated in hypothetical studies.
   Practical implications Customer loyalty is at stake for MFRs behaving
   irresponsible while it can be strengthened by responsible firm conduct.
   Originality/value This research is the first to highlight the importance
   consumers in Vietnam attach to responsible firm conduct. It also points
   to a lack of awareness of such behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Undercapitalization has been recognized as a problem affecting Italian

   capitalization positively relates with innovation levels. The latter is
   also confirmed to enhance co-operatives' performance. These results are

Abstract = {{Recently, the concept of supply chain management has been applied in the
   food chains with the idea of transforming agribusiness through
   networking and trustful partnership in the food chains. In this regard,
   it is important to consider the empirical knowledge of the interface
   among the variables of factors in the supply chain governance structure
   choices, the chain actors' choice of governance models, and the effects
   of these on the supply chain performances. The aim of this study was to
   empirically verify the relationships between factors existing in the
   business scenarios, the chain actors' governance structure choice, and
   supply chain performances of dairy chains in Ethiopia. The chains were
   assessed using the survey data that were collected from 215 chain actors
   and analyzed using structural equation modelling and IBM SPSS and IBM
   AMOS of version 24 software. The data collected were tested for the
   Cronbach's alpha reliability test for the internal consistency and using
   the different model goodness of fit measure tests. The results showed
   that the transaction cost, trust, and uncertainty significantly
   (P<0.001) predicted the chain actors' supply chain governance model
   choice. On the other hand, uncertainty, willingness to collaborate, and
   collaborations advantages explained trust significantly (P<0.001). The
   correlations analysis among the factors showed that there existed
   negative significant correlation between transaction cost and
   willingness to collaborate. The correlation between willingness to
   collaborate and collaborative advantages was found positive and
   significant. Similarly, the correlation between uncertainty and
   transaction specific investments was found positive and significant.
   Moreover, chain actors' supply chain governance structure choice
   significantly explained the supply chain performances, such as
   efficiency, flexibility, level of dairy losses, and level of
   integrations in the dairy chains. Promoting established dairy chain
   governance system, either through dependable relational governances or
   through formal contractual structure has been found improving the
   performances of the studied dairy chains.}},

Abstract = {{This paper conducts an exploratory analysis on the role of social
   capital in influencing both economic and social performance of farmer
   cooperatives based on a sample of 156 farmers from 54 vegetable
   cooperatives in China's Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. Social capital is
   distinguished into bonding and bridging dimensions, with the former
   referring to the internal aspect of social capital and the latter the
   external ``Guanxi{''} (meaning relationship) possessed by core members.
   The statistical results display that specific dimensions of social
   capital may not deliver the benefits expected by cooperative
   practitioners and academics. Both positive and negative effects of
   social capital on performances of farmer cooperatives are observed. To
   be specific, bonding social capital is positively associated with common
   members' economic benefits. Bridging social capital generates beneficial
   outcomes for the financial and social performances of cooperatives,
   while exhibiting negative influence on common members' income increase
   because of member heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Tomato juice has gained popularity in recent decades. However, little is
   known about tomato juice consumers in the United States. The goal of
   this research was to determine consumer attitudes towards current tomato
   juice offerings and willingness to pay for high flavor quality products.
   A sensory panel and a nation-wide survey were conducted to learn about
   consumer preference toward tomato juice consumption. A new ``label{''},
   including taste review ratings, was incorporated into a choice
   experiment to verify whether this information successfully assisted
   consumers in their purchase decisions. Both the sensory analysis and the
   consumer online survey showed a demand for tomato juice with better
   flavor. The results suggest that a premium quality tomato juice with
   fresh aroma notes and better taste made from a premium tomato will
   encourage consumer purchase intent. Consumers would be willing to pay up
   to 30\% more if trusted taste review score information was provided.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to model how risk governance (RG)
   influences risk prevention behaviors toward food safety issues,
   considering the perception of related risks in the Taiwanese context.
   Design/methodology/approach The national representative data on risk
   society modules from the Taiwan Social Change Survey data were used
   (sample size = 2,005). The procedure for the analysis consisted of
   investigation of the model fit indices of structural equation modeling,
   incorporating the mediation effect. Multiple-group analysis was used to
   examine the moderation effects.
   Findings Results show that the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the
   advanced TRA can accurately explain personal risk perception (RP)
   (R-2=0.40) and risk prevention (R-2=0.42). Results also suggest that RG
   institutions can affect personal RP and risk prevention through
   subjective norms. In addition, moderation effects of media and gender
   were found.

Abstract = {{Social capital plays an important role in the development of poultry
   farms in South Sulawesi. Poultry farms consisted of laying hen and
   broiler farms. Most of laying hen farms were located in Sidrap Regency,
   while broiler farms were located in Maros regency. The aim of this
   research was to know social capital on beef cattle farms in South
   Sulawesi. Population of this research was 120 farmers which consisted of
   6o were laying hen farmers and 60 were broiler farmers. Variable of
   social capital was mutual trust, reciprocity, shared norms and linkage.
   The data were collected from observation and depth interview by using
   questionnaire There were 10 questions. The answer was scored by using
   Likert scale ranging from 1 refer to strongly agree; 2 refer to agree; 3
   refer to not sure; 4 refer to disagree and 5 refer to strongly disagree.
   The data were analyzed descriptively using frequency distribution. The
   research revealed that mutual trust and shared norms members of the
   group in broiler farms have higher level than that on laying hen farms,
   on the other hand, linkage or net working members of the group among
   laying hen farmers has higher level than that on broiler farms.}},

   multiple regressions. The result shows that there was significant
   relationship between social capital in community and the income of the
   red guava farmers. Farmer' group was found as a media to improve
   farmers' knowledge and networking. Farmers group facilitated farmers to
   market red guava product. Moreover, wife of the farmers established
   women group or KWT (Kelompok Wanita Tani). The result found that KWT
   contributed to improve family's income. KWT also promote activities to
   help product's diversification of red guava. Both farmer group and KWT
   provided activities such as saving and loans, it means there was trust

Abstract = {{Purpose Despite the increasing consumers' intent to support short food
   networks, the expansion of short food supply chains (SFSCs) remains
   limited. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential antecedents
   of farmers' willingness to participate in SFSCs.
   Design/methodology/approach Using data from a sample of Greek farmers
   the authors examined whether farmers' citizenship behaviour, the levels
   of their perceived competencies and the degree to which they feel
   accepted by their communities affect their willingness to engage in
   SFSCs.
   Findings Results indicate that producers' citizenship behaviour does
   indeed have a positive impact on willingness to participate in SFSCs,
   whereas their perceptions of the acceptance they enjoy within their
   communities also significantly predict this willingness. On the
   contrary, self-perceived lack of communication and collaboration
   competencies diminishes this willingness.
   Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the
   first attempts to explore the role of farmers' competencies in their
   willingness to participate in SFSCs. In addition, by integrating
   concepts derived from multiple disciplines, our work adds new factors in
   the wide spectrum of forces that impel or suppress farmers' willingness
   to take part in alternative food distribution networks.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Controversies about meat consumption mainly stem from health and
   environmental concerns, and as a result a substantial number of
   consumers avoid consuming meat. Meat anti-consumption is a central topic
   in nutrition, and a relevant issue for consumer studies. The purpose of
   this paper is to understand why and how consumers avoid meat
   consumption.
   Design/methodology/approach A content analysis of web forums was
   conducted.
   Findings Meat avoiders think that meat is unhealthy and expensive. Other
   reasons for meat anti-consumption include concerns associated with
   lifestyle and sustainability, but the prevalence of these factors is
   considerably lower than health and economic concerns.
   Research limitations/implications Attitudes toward all kinds of meat
   were evaluated in the forum data. Further studies can be conducted on
   separate preferences for red or white meat. Since these data were
   collected from web forums in Turkey, research can also be extended to
   other countries.
   Practical implications Regarding health and sustainability concerns,
   consumer trust in producers and consumer consciousness about the
   environment may be improved by social marketing. To address lifestyle
   concerns, marketers can provide meatless offerings in convenient
   servings.
   Originality/value This study provides a coherent four-dimensional
   conceptual framework about the motives for meat anti-consumption,
   focusing on sustainability, personal health, economic concerns and
   lifestyle.}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2466-2482}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to gain insight on parental
   attitudes towards weaning practices and weaning foods for health in
   Malaysia using Q-methodology.
   Design/methodology/approach The study population was parents that had a
   child aged three years or less. A total of 47 parents were recruited to
   partake in a one-on-one activity which involved sorting 69 statements
   about weaning practices and weaning food products into a grid that was
   normally distributed ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
   Sorting was immediately followed by a short interview to understand the
   reasons behind the placement of particular statements.
   Findings Data analysis identified three statistically distinct
   participant attitudes towards weaning practices and foods for health
   that were then interpreted using the rich qualitative data from the
   post-sort interviews. The attitudes identified were All Homemade and
   Natural, Commercial Convenience and Trust and Balance and Variety.
   Originality/value This study identified the dominant sets of attitudes
   held by Malaysian parents towards weaning practices and weaning foods
   for health using Q-methodology. To authors' knowledge, this is the first
   paper focussing on weaning foods for health, specifically on functional
   weaning food. This new understanding of shared attitudes will allow
   product developers, marketers and health communicators to more
   effectively design their products and their marketing mix to ensure that
   these messages resonate well with the target audience who want to
   provide the best weaning foods possible for their children.}},

Abstract = {{Northern Ghana needs effective early warning system against its
   climate-induced vulnerabilities. Though there are a plethora of early
   warning information channels, the challenge often lies in identifying
   effective communication tool that would spur the vulnerable community
   into action and its mediating mechanisms. This is against the backdrop
   that prior studies indicate that information does not automatically lead
   to action without individual's personal interpretation. Trust is thus
   seen as a key mediator between the sources of information and
   individual's disaster response rate. Based on our field studies from
   Northern Ghana, we empirically explore the relationship between trust,
   risk perception, and the acceptance of preventive actions by comparing
   two models of trust: the causal chain and the associationist view. We
   examine whether the relationship between trust in information sources
   and the disaster-preventive action is mediated by the risk perception
   (i.e., the causal chain model) or whether the risk perception and trust
   in information sources are expressions of a more general attitude toward
   disaster preparedness (i.e., the associationist view model). Our
   findings challenge the conventional causal chain model and suggest that
   trust does not necessarily influence the acceptance of a
   disaster-preventing actions (e.g., evacuation). Rather, trust is more of
   a reflection of the individual's general attitude toward disaster
   preparedness, which is shaped by his/her cultural norms.}},

Title = {{Determinants of response of street food entrepreneurs in Ghana to
   business management training}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{391-405}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Considering the fact that business management training has the
   potential to improve performance of micro and small enterprises, it is
   surprising why participation rates in most freely offered management
   training courses remain low. The purpose of this paper is to explore
   factors that determine an invitee's decision to participate in a
   capacity building management training for street food entrepreneurs in
   Ghana.
   Design/methodology/approach Using data from a baseline survey, the study
   invited 314 street food entrepreneurs, selected through a stratified
   random technique from a list of 516 eligible food entrepreneurs.
   Training participants were invited to the programme through official
   invitation letters which were hand-delivered. Data on reasons for
   non-participation were collected either through phone interviews or
   on-site visit when a vendor could not be reached on phone. Descriptive
   statistics were used to summarise characteristics of vendors and
   businesses as well as reasons for non-participation while probit model
   was used to estimate determinants of participation.
   Findings The study found that whereas vendors with higher formal
   education better appreciate the benefits of education and training,
   their counterparts with fewer years of schooling do not. The latter's
   perceived knowledge deficiencies appear to explain the difference in
   participation rates. Also, total workforce does not necessarily increase
   the probability of participation, especially when there are no trusted
   workers in the business who will take over critical activities such as
   handling of finances in the absence of the owner. The study also found
   that distance between vending premises and training centres had
   significant negative effects on vendors' participation in the training
   programme.
   Research limitations/implications The external validity of the study
   findings and conclusions may not be limited to all informal sectors of
   the developing economies due to high degree of heterogeneity of the
   informal economy.
   Originality/value The study focusses on an informal sector in developing
   country dominated by women. The study focusses on understanding informal
   entrepreneurs' response to formal training.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing Iranian consumers' attitudes toward fast-food
   consumption}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{409-423}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Eating patterns around the world have changed considerably,
   including food choices and preparation. One of these alterations in food
   consumption patterns is an increase in desire for fast-food consumption,
   which has been associated with poor diet quality. In order to analyze
   consumers' food consumption behaviors, it is necessary to account for
   psychological factors (e.g. attitudes) that shape behaviors. Thus, the
   purpose of this paper is to explore influencing factors on the attitudes
   of consumers in Isfahan City toward fast-food consumption, so as to
   understand why consumers use fast-food despite widespread knowledge of
   the negative health consequences.
   Design/methodology/approach - The predominant paradigm of the present
   study was quantitative, in that it was a correlational survey. The
   population of this study consisted of consumers who lived in Isfahan
   city in June 2015. A total sample of 350 people was selected using
   convenience sampling. Data were collected through a face-to-face
   interview with the consumers using a researcher-made questionnaire.
   Analysis was conducted using SPSS (V20) and AMOS (V20) software and a
   set of correlation and differential tests.
   Findings - The results revealed that ``health consciousness{''} and
   ``trust{''} are the main effective factors on the attitudes of the
   respondents. The results also revealed that the elder and married
   respondents have more positive attitudes toward fast-food consumption.
   Originality/value - It is worth mentioning that fast-food has become an
   important part of the Iranian diet. These findings have both academic
   and policy implications. The results showed that the need for much more
   consumer education regarding fast-food and mass media could effectively
   be used. Further, the government should support and subsidize fast-food
   restaurants so that they may produce healthier food options.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{549-562}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate where students in a
   Swedish compulsory school acquire their knowledge of food safety and how
   trustworthy they deem them to be.
   Design/methodology/approach A survey of students' self-reported sources
   of and trust in food safety knowledge was performed. A student response
   system was used for data collection, and the students were asked to
   answer questions presented on a PowerPoint presentation using a small
   wireless handheld device: a clicker. A questionnaire with 24 questions
   was used, and the responses were collected at 18 different schools with
   a total of 529 participants attending school Year 9.
   Findings Mothers were reported as being the most important source of
   food safety knowledge (38 per cent), especially among girls, and were
   also given high credibility (36 per cent). Boys reported trusting home
   and consumer studies (HCS), fathers and media to a higher extent. Girls
   reported cooking at home more often but, for all students, it was more
   common to rarely or never cook at home, which is why HCS teaching can be
   seen as valuable for many students. HCS teaching needs to be improved in
   order to raise its credibility. About half of the students (51 per cent)
   reported to have the highest trust for their source of knowledge.
   Research limitations/implications The students could only choose one
   source of knowledge and trust, although it is usual to learn from many
   different sources.
   Practical implications HCS teaching needs to get higher credibility
   among students as a counterweight against other sources.
   Social implications Educated consumers could influence their health.
   Originality/value Limited research has been performed on food safety
   knowledge among adolescents.}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{676-689}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the role and importance
   of trust in a type of Chinese farmer cooperative organization called
   Farm Bases (FBs), considering the extent to which trust affects their
   performance and how the relationship between trust and FB performance is

   considerations.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors interviewed a random sample of
   355 farmers, most of whom are from 42 different FBs in China. The
   authors operationalized organizational trust by assessing the perception
   of trustworthiness and competence that farmers have in FB managers. The
   authors conducted a regression analysis of the data to answer the
   research questions.
   Findings The findings support a nuanced role of trust for performance
   measures of FBs. Trust matters but in limited and specific contexts.
   Specifically, trust does not correlate with the marketing volume of
   Chinese FBs and only weakly correlates with FB compliance of production
   standards.
   Originality/value FBs play an essential role in China's agribusiness
   policies and are pervasive in Chinese business practices. Very little
   research has been conducted on Chinese FBs and of the role of trust in

Abstract = {{The competition in international food markets is increasingly moving
   towards products with higher levels of added value and higher degrees of
   differentiation, requiring companies to become more market-oriented.
   Market orientation is `the extent to which an actor in the marketplace
   uses knowledge about the market, especially about customers, as a basis
   for decision-making on what to produce, how to produce it, and how to
   market it'. Market orientation comprises three constructs: market
   intelligence generation, dissemination and responsiveness. Value chain
   governance can facilitate market orientation requirements. Value chain
   governance includes network governance, contracting and informal
   relationships. Knowledge about how governance can facilitate a value
   chain's market orientation is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study
   is to explore how the governance of a global food value chain can
   facilitate the value chain's market orientation. The study applies a
   multiple case study design. Four in-depth case studies were conducted on
   global food value chains from New Zealand to Western Europe dealing with
   the products apples, kiwis, venison and lamb. Interviews were conducted
   with actors from these four value chains in the Netherlands as well as
   in New Zealand. In each value chain actors with similar functions were
   interviewed in order to make the results comparable. Analysis of the
   case studies shows that network governance (i.e. leadership, shared
   governance and facilitation), contractual agreements (i.e. type and
   content: price, volume, quality) and informal relationships (i.e. trust
   and commitment) can contribute to the market orientation of a value
   chain. Leaderships and shared governance, in combination with good
   informal relationships in the chain, as well as contractual incentives,
   are main contributors to market orientation in global fresh food value
   chains. The paper adds to the still very scarce literature on governance
   of value chains and market orientation of value chains.}},

Title = {{How Does Suppliers' Fairness Affect the Relationship Quality of
   Agricultural Product Supply Chains?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{Although many studies have suggested that the relationship between
   different supply chain members significantly affects agricultural
   product quality, suppliers' perceptions of fairness, which greatly
   influence their decisions on building the relationship quality, are
   often overlooked. Particularly, the empirical evidence to investigate
   the impacts of suppliers' fairness on the relationship quality and the
   factors that affect the suppliers' fairness is missing, and therefore
   this knowledge gap needs to be filled by new research. Herein, we
   conducted a survey of 450 agricultural product suppliers and
   systemically analyzed the impact of antecedents on fairness perception
   and the impact of fairness perception on relationship quality. In
   addition, we developed a structural equation model and found that
   information sharing and price satisfaction had significantly positive
   effects on procedural fairness and distributive fairness, respectively.
   Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that procedural fairness is more
   important in improving the relationship quality than distributive
   fairness. However, supplier dependence is another important impact
   factor, and it greatly decreases the positive effects of suppliers'
   fairness on relationship quality. In summary, the study results provide
   several managerial implications and extend our understanding of the
   importance of suppliers' fairness in the relationship quality, which
   involves product development with respect to the supplier's performance.}},

Title = {{Food Integrity and Food Technology Concerns in Canada: Evidence from Two
   Public Surveys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{Food integrity and food technologies both generate public concerns.
   There is little research to show the interactions between those concerns
   in particular samples, especially in Canada. In this paper, data from
   two national online samples are used to examine an aggregate of food
   integrity concerns, genetic modification in food, and food
   nanotechnology concerns in the Canadian public. A variety of trust,
   health, environmental, and science attitude variables are used to help
   explain the concerns that vary across the population. In addition, the
   food integrity concerns are tested as explanatory variables in the
   technology concern models to establish whether there is a strong or weak
   link between the two. Tobit and ordered probit regressions are used to
   model the variables for each of the survey samples. Results are examined
   to see if they are consistent across surveys and also consistent with an
   earlier study that was done in Australia. The results suggest that trust
   in people and trust in a variety of agents within the food system are
   beliefs that ameliorate concerns about food integrity and the two
   technologies. However, trust in advocacy organizations appears to be
   related to higher concerns in each case. Fundamentally and similar to
   the earlier Australian study, positive scientific attitudes are a major
   determinant of reduced concerns about food integrity and the two
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The U.K. food and grocery market is highly significant financially and
   dominated by 10 retailers within a regulated and extremely economically
   competitive environment. We summarize the approach of U.K. retailers to
   allergen risk assessment (RA) and risk management (RM) within the U.K.
   legal framework and explore public visibility of retailers' allergen
   policies. RA and RM of allergens appear effective in curtailing retail
   triggered severe food allergy reactions. However, allergen recalls
   remain high, precautionary allergen labeling (PAL) remains an area of
   confusion, and there is no consistent Web-based provision of information
   for consumers who have allergies. Resolution of PAL awaits an agreed-on
   threshold framework, but a key challenge is to engage with patients and
   gain their trust rather than thrust education at them. It would be
   helpful for retailers to publish their allergen RA and RM policies. A
   target should be agreed on between government and retailers for a
   reduction in the proliferation of PAL wording variants by a given date
   within the next 3 years. A further hurdle is potentially flawed allergen
   analysis development of reference methods and reference materials are
   acknowledged needs. Laboratories should report allergen results in an
   informative manner, communicating uncertainty and caveats. Ideally a
   laboratory representative would be included on any incident control
   team. Efforts must continue to standardize preparedness for protecting
   and defending food and drink from deliberate attack.}},

Abstract = {{Food Allergy Awareness Week was created with the purpose of placing a
   spotlight on the seriousness of food allergies. Recognized in the United
   States in mid-May every year, Food Allergy Awareness Week serves as a
   reminder of the over 15 million Americans who suffer from food
   allergies. The importance of allergies and allergen labeling can be seen
   when looking at U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall data: of the
   764 recalls in 2016, 305 (representing more than 40\%) were due to
   undeclared allergens. However, recalls for undeclared allergens are a
   complex issue with numerous factors. The implementation of
   prevention-based systems with the necessary management components and
   further error proofing the systems, along with allergen awareness
   embedded throughout a company's food safety culture, can likely help
   reduce the number of recalls for undeclared allergens. As a resource to
   manufacturers, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food
   Allergy Research and Resource Program have developed several resources
   to assist with developing robust allergen management programs. By
   reducing the number of recalls for undeclared allergens, the food
   industry will likely increase and maintain consumer confidence and trust
   of the food-allergic community. This enhanced consumer confidence and
   trust could eventually open the door for further collaboration with the
   food-allergic community and, potentially, advance allergen-related
   policies.}},

Title = {{Expanding the theory of planned behaviour to predict Chinese Muslims
   halal meat purchase intention}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-17}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants
   of halal meat consumption within the population of Chinese Muslims in
   China using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as a conceptual
   framework. The role of self-identity as a Muslim, dietary acculturation
   in the host culture, moral obligation to purchase halal meat and trust
   on the authenticity of halal meat are explored.
   Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional data were collected
   through a survey with 378 Chinese Muslims, currently living in Beijing
   and Xian cities. Data were analysed by means of correlations and
   stepwise multiple regressions to test the model and the moderating
   effects of self-identity, dietary acculturation, moral obligation and
   trust on behavioural intention.
   Findings - A positive personal attitude towards the consumption of halal
   meat, personal conviction, motivation to comply, perceived control over
   consuming halal meat and perceived availability of halal meat predict
   the intention to eat halal meat among Chinese Muslims.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the focus on
   only four individual characteristics related to religious food
   consumption, namely, self-identity, dietary acculturation, moral
   obligation and trust. Additional individual characteristics such as
   individualism-collectivism and involvement or values could improve the
   predictive power of the model.
   Practical implications - Practical implications extend to food marketers
   and food policy decision-makers who might pursue identity,
   acculturation, trustworthiness and moral obligation-related strategies
   in their distribution and communication efforts targeted at the growing
   halal food market segments across China and worldwide.
   Originality/value - The current study addresses the important limitation
   of previous studies regarding the inclusion of additional possible
   individual characteristics such as moral obligation and trust in the TPB
   model to investigate the determinants of halal meat consumption within a
   food-religion context.}},

Title = {{Hybrid modelling of the consumption of organic foods in Iran using
   exploratory factor analysis and an artificial neural network}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{44-58}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore a hybrid model of the
   consumption of organic foods, combining the use of exploratory factor
   analysis (EFA) and an artificial neural network (ANN).
   Design/methodology/approach - The study has three phases. In the first
   phase, the Delphi method is employed, and 15 motives for the consumption
   of organic food are identified; these motives are used to develop the
   model in the second phase. Finally, in the last phase, an ANN is used to
   rank themotives to determine their priority.
   Findings - The EFA model explored includes four factors that have a
   positive effect on the level of organic food consumption. These are
   naturalness, trust, sanitariness and marketing. Results from the use of
   an ANN indicate that the main variables in organic food consumption are
   claims, psychological variables and doubt. From the results of the EFA
   model it is clear these three variables are components of the factor of
   trust.
   Practical implications - Marketers can use the model developed in this
   paper to satisfy the needs of their customers and hence enhance their
   market share and profitability. This study shows that improvements in
   truth in the claims made for organic products, perceived security from
   using these products and doubts about the safety of other foods can lead
   marketers to their goal. Informative advertisements can inculcate trust
   and naturalness among consumers as main factors.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is the light it
   sheds on how consumers think about organic foods. It develops a model
   incorporating motives for consuming organic food and determining the
   priorities held by consumers of organic foods.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyse knowledge of food quality labels as
   well as satisfaction with food quality and trust in the origin of food
   in a selected population of the Czech Republic. The paper is based on
   primary research carried out in the form of data collection through a
   questionnaire implemented jointly by the Department of Trade and Finance
   at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague and the State
   Agricultural Intervention Fund of the Czech Republic. There were 857 (n
   = 857) respondents in the survey - housewives between 25 and 55 years.
   From the total number of respondents, 75.1\% knew at least one food
   quality label and only 5.0\% were not aware of any labelling. Most
   respondents named the labels ``Klasa{''}, ``Cesky vyrobek{''} ({''}Czech
   Product{''}), ``Regionalni potravina{''} ({''}Regional Food{''}) and
   ``Bio{''} ({''}Organic{''}). This part of the survey showed a dependence
   between knowledge of at least one quality label and level of education.
   From the total number of respondents who knew at least one food quality
   label, 74.4\% said they had confidence in Czech food. 22.5\% do not
   differentiate between Czech and imported food and only 3.1\% prefer
   foreign food. From the total number of respondents, 74.6\% are satisfied
   with the quality of Czech food while 25.4\% find it unsatisfactory. In
   terms of trust and satisfaction with food quality in the Czech Republic,
   we observed no statistical dependence on the variables of age, education
   and size of the municipality where the respondents live.}},

Abstract = {{An effort made by rice farmers in maintaining their bargaining position
   in the management of rice farming financing is by conducting arisan
   gabah. The purpose of this study was to describe the management system
   of and find out about the benefits of arisan gabah. The research
   location was selected purposively, in Muktisari Village, Gandrungmangu
   Subdistrict, Cilacap Regency. The sampling technique was by Proportional
   Random Sampling, i.e. randomly selecting samples in each arisan gabah
   group, so there was a sample of 50 members of arisan gabah and the
   chairman of each group (7 people). The results of the study showed that
   arisan gabah in Muktisari Village was managed in a simple and voluntary
   system where trust among members was a priority. Arisan gabah as a local
   wisdom of village community had four main priorities, namely the
   fulfillment of consumption needs, savings, home repair costs and
   education costs. Arisan gabah is one form of arisan whose payment uses
   non cash in the form of grains, where the management of the financial
   institutions of village community serves as an effort to get access to
   farming financing and life needs fulfilment.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{190-198}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Consumer demand for organic food and non-food products has been growing
   dramatically. This study examines organic consumption behavior from a
   social identification perspective. Focusing on the central role of
   organic consumer identification (OCI), or the extent to which
   individuals categorize themselves as organic consumers, this study
   theorizes and empirically establishes environmental consumer
   identification, organic product-related cognitions (i.e., organic
   product familiarity and trustworthiness), and their interactions as key
   antecedents of OCI. As importantly, we show that the positive effect of
   OCI on consumer loyalty to organic products is contingent upon both
   prevailing social norms of organic consumption and the perceived price
   of organic products. In establishing these relationships, this study
   paints a more nuanced, comprehensive and generalizable picture of what
   drives consumer social identification and what are its consequences in
   the domain of organic consumption. It offers several important
   implications for theory and practice.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{237-245}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Consumers are increasingly interested in the practices surrounding food
   production. Transparency has been identified as a key component of
   consumer trust building to earn social license for innovations in plant
   biotechnology. However, the increasing complexity of these technologies
   has made clear, that concise communication between experts and the
   public is a challenge. The present research applies appeal ratings and
   CATA (Check-all that-apply), supplemented with in-person interviews to
   verify comprehension, in order to refine wording around explanations of
   plant breeding tools. Appeal ratings and CATA were able to successfully
   distinguish preferred phrasings to improve the wording around food
   production processes. Based on the outcomes, recommendations are made to
   avoid technical jargon and plant anthropomorphisms, add back familiarity
   (for example with images of people or familiar processes) and address
   the fear of unintended consequences. This research is the first attempt
   to use appeal ratings and CATA to fine-tune message wording and
   demonstrates the utility of the protocol for use by consumer and sensory
   researchers to assist marketing teams with developing optimal product
   taglines or to aid PR and communications groups within their

Abstract = {{Since the 1950ies, corporate social responsibility is gaining more
   importance worldwide both in theory and practice. In the agribusiness
   sector, corporate social responsibility is now firmly on the agenda of
   many companies. A sub-sector of agribusiness, and a particularly
   interest for the wider public is the poultry sector. The German market
   offers a high economic potential, but poultry firms in Germany are
   increasingly confronted with the skeptical views of critical consumers.
   Corporate social responsibility can provide a proactive approach for
   companies to take responsibility for corporate actions and respond to
   consumers' requirements. The central issue of this paperis to examine
   which corporate social responsibility activities are particularly
   important to consumers. With the help of an adaptive conjoint analysis,
   the preferences of 250 consumers were collected via an online
   questionnaire and subsequently analyzed. It becomes apparent that
   consumers are most concerned by themes which affect them or their own
   consumption, like product quality. But also topics with high media
   attention, such as animal welfare issues, are relevant. The results
   provide interesting starting points for the further development of
   corporate social responsibility concepts in the poultry sector.}},

Abstract = {{Agro-industries have been widely acknowledged as a way to kick-start
   agricultural development in developing regions. A number of pro-poor
   organizations promote production models that include the engagement of
   smallholder farmers as potential enablers for employment generation,
   economic development and livelihood improvements. Initiatives such as
   this appear in Sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on food and bioenergy
   crops. However, the large-scale production of cash crops, such as
   sugarcane, also raises concerns. A critical aspect is the impact of
   land-use on food security, particularly if local communities are
   constrained in cultivating traditional crops. In this paper, we explore
   the relationship between a sugarcane mill and smallholder farmers in
   Maputo province, Mozambique. Our main goal was to investigate some key
   characteristics of sugarcane outgrower schemes and the implications for
   sustainable local development. We also complemented local findings with
   lessons learnt from other regions, such as Brazil. In August 2015, a
   field assessment examined the interplay between the sugarcane industry
   and local communities in southern Mozambique. We interviewed three
   smallholders' associations of sugarcane producers in Xinavane, together
   with researchers, non-governmental organizations and agricultural
   government bodies. Our assessment finds that the impacts of sugarcane
   remain somewhat unclear. Government bodies and some of the consulted
   NGOs claim benefits, both on income and local food production. However,
   these benefits are less evident to farmers. While they acknowledge
   labour and social services as opportunities brought by the sugar mill,
   progress on capacity building and irrigated areas for food production
   fall short of expectations. Moreover, there is also tension as to the
   sugarcane outgrower contract. Incomplete information seems to undermine
   trust from farmers who become increasingly sceptical of their contracts
   with the sugarcane mill, especially the payment system. Transparency,
   coupled with more effective food production strategies, are decisive to
   ensure sustainable agro-industrial development along with poverty
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Misconduct in global meat supply chains are omnipresent and even more so
   in differentiated chains where credence attributes such as origin and
   taste are used to differentiate the product. By definition, these
   attributes signal asymmetric information which implies that in the
   presence of bounded rational individuals with conflicting interests,
   misconduct in the form of opportunistic behavior is bound to prevail.
   Increased information exchange through farmer networks is, however,
   expected to reduce opportunistic behavior. In the case of a
   differentiated meat product, such as Karoo Lamb, the article studies the
   farmer-abattoir transaction with the purpose of recommending strategies
   that can be implemented to reduce the farmer's tendency to behave
   opportunistically. The article employs the PLS approach to SEM and
   reveals a significant negative relationship between information shared
   and opportunistic behavior. The results indicate significant positive
   relationships between trust in the abattoir and information shared as
   well as between farmer networks and information shared. These results
   are indicative of the support provided to the information shared
   construct by higher levels of trust between farmers and abattoirs and
   established farmer networks. It is, therefore, recommended that
   differentiated meat supply chains, through their various associations,
   concentrate their efforts to promote information sharing by building
   stronger, trust centered relationships and by supporting farmer
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{The normal distribution, under its popular name `the bell curve', has
   attracted adverse criticism in recent years, owing mainly to being
   prominently featured in some well-publicised books on socio-economic
   topics. A number of conclusions in these fields, ranging from
   questionable to spectacularly incorrect, have been drawn from an
   ill-considered use of the bell curve as a statistical tool. Those
   application sectors do not directly impinge on chemical measurement but
   the toxic fallout has been widespread and likely to bias the reading
   public against inferences based on the normal distribution. It is
   therefore essential that analytical chemists should be able to recognise
   appropriate and inappropriate uses of the normal distribution and to
   defend their decisions adequately when working alongside those
   unfamiliar with measurement and statistics.}},

Abstract = {{The food donation process in Belgium is mapped and analyzed to identify
   bottlenecks in compliance with the legal framework and implementation of
   food safety management, based on literature search and interviews with
   stakeholders (donors, acceptors, regulators and facilitators) in Belgium
   and at EU level. The study revealed that the food donation/acceptation
   chain is far less structured and organized than the conventional food
   supply chain. The fragmented landscape of many small food banks and
   charity organizations (acceptors), often directed by and working with
   volunteers without training in food safety and lack of knowledge of
   legal food hygiene requirements is a bottleneck to generate trust among
   food donors and restricts the provision of perishable products in food
   donations. Lack of refrigerated transport and insufficient cold/freezing
   capacity in food banks and charity organizations was identified as a
   barrier to distribute perishable products. Furthermore, in two cities in
   Flanders (Belgium), at some food donation centers, donated perishable
   food samples (n = 72) were taken and subjected to microbiological
   analysis to determine their overall food quality, hygiene and food
   safety status. Twenty-two of 72 analyzed samples showed marginal
   microbiological quality based on numbers of yeast, lactic acid bacteria
   or total viable count. In three samples Listeria monocytogenes was
   detected per 25 g among which one ready-to-eat cooked meat product which
   showed increased numbers of L. monocytogenes (3.5 log CFU/g) and
   Enterobacteriaceae (6.7 log CFU/g). Overall, in Belgium, most of the
   donated foods considers nonperishable foods, with more or less half of
   the food collected by the food banks being purchased with funds from
   FEAD (Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived) and thus not derived
   from food losses. Efforts are being made by facilitators to provide a
   platform for better coordination of donors and acceptors to make more
   efficient use of food losses. Regulators at the national level are
   taking action to clarify and provide some flexibility in food hygiene
   regulation and initiatives on EU level to facilitate food donation in
   the combat of food losses are pending. As from the side of the
   acceptors, it is recommended to professionalize the acceptation chain in
   Belgium and seek for a more harmonized approach and concerted action.}},

Abstract = {{Consumers' trust in general and specifically in food system agents may
   reduce uncertainties when they make choices among credence attributes
   such as production methods. In this study, we assess the linkages
   between consumers' trust (generalized and institutional trust) and their
   preferences for traditionally raised pork. Data were collected through
   an online survey including a stated preference experiment in Canada in
   2011. Results suggest that both low and high trusting consumers are
   willing to pay significant premiums for traditionally raised pork over
   conventional pork. Willingness to pay values are higher for the high
   trust group as compared to the low trust group. Respondents with higher
   levels of trust rated traditionally raised pork more positively (in
   comparison to conventional pork) in terms of taste, freshness, safety,
   healthiness, and not containing hormones and antibiotics as compared to
   those respondents who have lower levels of trust. Government
   certification of traditionally raised pork is important for both
   consumers with low and high trust. The fact that high trust respondents
   were more in favor of this production credence attribute suggests that
   providing it in the market may require additional efforts to convince
   more of the lower trust individuals that this attribute is worth
   additional expenditure.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive pests and diseases in trees impose a range of costs on society
   related to reductions in timber values, impacts on recreational
   opportunities and effects on forest biodiversity. These costs need to be
   considered when assessing control options and developing public policy.
   We investigate the preferences and willingness to pay of the UK general
   public for a range of forest disease control measures using a choice
   experiment with a sample of 605 people. Respondents were relatively well
   informed about general tree disease-related issues, such as causes and
   general measures to minimise the risk of disease spread. They were less
   knowledgeable about specific tree diseases, with Dutch elm disease and
   chalara ash dieback being the most well known. We find that disease
   control programmes in publicly-owned forests and forests owned by
   charitable trusts are more likely to be supported by the public than
   equivalent control programmes in privately-owned and/or commercial
   forests. The nature of scientific uncertainty about diseases does not
   affect peoples' preferences for disease control measures significantly.
   Higher respondent income, greater ex-ante knowledge about tree diseases,
   and more frequent visits to forests are correlated with greater
   willingness to support publicly-funded tree disease control programmes
   in forests. Better knowledge about tree diseases also improves the
   clarity of respondents' choices. We find a negative sentiment against
   some disease control measures, such as clear felling of a forest, and
   chemical or biocide spraying. We conclude that there is significant
   public support for part-financing forest disease control policies in the
   UK, but that this is conditional on forest ownership and the type of
   control measures used.}},

   Studies were coded for themes about social media applications, benefits,
   limitations, and best practices. Trust and personal beliefs were
   important drivers of social media use. The wide reach, immediacy, and
   information gathering capacities of social media were frequently cited
   benefits. Suggestions for social media best practices were inconsistent

Abstract = {{Consumers are increasingly exposed to labels communicating specific
   processing aspects of food production, and recent state and federal
   legislation in the United States has called for making some of these
   labels mandatory. This article reviews the literature in this area and
   identifies the positive and negative aspects of labeling food processes.
   The good parts are that, under appropriate third-party or governmental
   oversight, process labels can effectively bridge the informational gap
   between producers and consumers, satisfy consumer demand for broader and
   more stringent quality assurance criteria, and ultimately create value
   for both consumers and producers. Despite the appeal of the ``Consumer
   Right to Know{''} slogan, process labeling also can have serious
   unintentional consequences. The bad parts are that consumers can
   misinterpret these labels and thus misalign their personal preferences
   and their actual food purchases. The ugly parts are that these labels
   can stigmatize food produced with conventional processes even when there
   is no scientific evidence that they cause harm, or even that it is
   compositionally any different. Based on this review of the literature,
   we provide three policy recommendations: (i) mandatory labeling of food
   processes should occur only in situations in which the product has been
   scientifically demonstrated to harm human health; (ii) governments
   should not impose bans on process labels because this approach goes
   against the general desire of consumers to know about and have control
   over the food they are eating, and it can undermine consumer trust of
   the agricultural sector; and (iii) a prudent policy approach is to
   encourage voluntary process labeling, perhaps using smart phone
   technology similar to that proposed in 2016 federal legislation related
   to foods containing ingredients that were genetically engineered.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in middle-income
   countries is having significant detrimental health effects. Beverage
   choices are influenced by consumers' perceptions of products.
   Understanding the factors influencing perceptions is essential to
   reducing consumption of unhealthy beverages. To date little research has
   been conducted in this area, particularly outside of Western contexts.
   This study aimed to examine the health-related perceptions of
   non-alcoholic beverages and associated factors in five countries in the
   Asia Pacific region.
   A cross-sectional online survey was administered to middle-class
   household food providers in Melbourne, Shanghai, Vietnam, Indonesia and
   Singapore (n = 3951, 57\% female). Participants rated the healthiness of
   common beverages and information on demographics, trust in sources of
   nutrition information and personal values was obtained. Data was
   analysed via principal components analysis and multiple linear
   regressions.
   Results demonstrated that both demographic and psychographic factors
   were associated with the perceived healthiness of beverages. Respondents
   perceived beverage healthiness in four types: sweetened, heavily
   marketed beverages, milk-based and children's products, unsweetened,
   minimally processed beverages and waters. The perceived healthiness of
   sweetened, heavily marketed beverages and milk-based and children's
   products was higher in Vietnam, Shanghai and Indonesia than in Singapore
   and Melbourne and positively associated with trust in industry sources
   of nutrition information and hedonist values. Perceiving unsweetened,
   minimally processed beverages as healthy was associated with trust in
   health authorities and equality-nature values.
   Reducing the perceived healthiness and consumption of unhealthy chinks
   requires nutrition education that responds to economic and cultural
   contexts and frames messages to appeal to prevailing personal values.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the food safety incidents happened frequently in china and
   the customer confidence declined rapidly, then the problems related to
   food quality and safety have attracted more and more social attention.
   Considering the concern with regard to food quality assurance and
   consumer confidence improvement, many companies have developed a
   traceability system to visualize the supply chain and avoid food safety
   incidents. In this paper, we proposed an improved food traceability
   system which can not only achieve forward tracking and diverse tracing
   like the existing systems do, but also evaluate the food quality timely
   along the supply chain and provide consumers with these evaluating
   information, to mainly enhance the consumer experience and help firms
   gain the trust of consumers. For the food quality evaluation, the method
   of fuzzy classification was used to evaluate the food quality at each
   stages of supply chain while the artificial neural network was adopted
   to derive the final determination of the grade of food quality according
   to all the stage quality evaluations. A case study of a pork producer
   was conducted, and the results showed that the improved traceability
   system performed well in food quality assurance and evaluation. In
   addition, implications of the proposed approach were discussed, and
   suggestions for future work were outlined. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A systematical study was performed to investigate the processing
   workflow of LC-MS-based metabolomics data by optimizing parameter
   settings in XCMS software and comparing different preprocessing methods.
   Here we use a spike-in experiment combining with design of experiment
   (DoE) approaches for optimizing XCMS software parameters. A trusted
   index, which was based on accuracy evaluation of the spike-in data, was
   employed to assess the optimizing process. After optimizing the XCMS
   setting, the trusted index was improved from 3.67 to 30 and positive
   rate of spike-in standards also increased from 20\% to 100\%. Moreover,
   different data preprocessing methods, such as normalization, different
   scaling methods were also investigated on spike-in data since they were
   found to affect the outcome of the data analysis and ions features
   identification. Accordingly, UN-normalization and Pareto scaling were
   chosen as appropriate preprocessing methods to deal with LC-MS data
   through the evaluation of match index (mainly applied multivariate
   statistics methods). Finally, the optimized workflow was applied to
   experimental samples that acquired from metabolomics experiment and
   analyzed randomly with spike-in sample, which indicated a better
   applicability in formal metabolomics experiment. It is concluded that
   the proposed data processing workflow could be used as feasible approach
   for improving the quality of LC-MS-based metabolomics data and ensured
   the veracity of metabolites identification in data processing procedures
   to a certain extent.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple hurdles to commercial translation of next generation active
   food packaging technologies have been responsible for few successes
   among a sea of potentially promising innovations over the past 30 years.
   The development process involves numerous critical points originating at
   the basic research level, continuing through the raw material, package,
   and food manufacturing supply chains, and ending with consumer retail
   acceptance and purchase, which may fail to advance active packages into
   commercial markets. Complex regulatory and environmental sustainability
   concerns present a distinct global challenge to new technology transfer
   that will continue to directly impact economic growth and limit growth
   potential of next generation active food technologies. Understanding the
   identified challenges of active packaging technology commercial
   translation within the defined areas of academic research,
   manufacturing, regulatory (safety and environmental), and consumer
   acceptance will lead to systems based solutions for increasing
   availability of these technologies within a global marketplace.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of the global food trade has increased significantly over the
   last two decades. The purpose of this review paper is to compare
   imported food safety controls in Taiwan, Japan, the United States, and
   the European Union. Our key findings are: 1) imported food of animal and
   non-animal origin is by separate, competent authorities in Taiwan,
   Japan, and the US, whereas it is controlled by a single authority in the
   EU, 2) foreign facilities require registration in the US and Japan, 3)
   importing high-risk food in the EU, Taiwan and Japan requires the
   competent authority to inspect the food chain process and facilities in
   the third country, whereas a US FDA's accredited third party auditor can
   do so in the US, 4) an advanced developed support systems for enabling
   the effectiveness and efficiency of imported food control can only be
   found in the EU and US. These findings may help the competent
   authorities responsible for imported food safety in Taiwan and the other
   countries to develop and enhance their own systems, not only to meet the
   international standards but importantly for the sake of public health
   protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer trust in the food industry is heavily reliant upon accurate

   matured frozen-thawed beef using the entire spectral range (CCR = 1.00).
   The performance of reduced spectral models is also investigated. Overall
   it was found that CIELAB co-ordinates can be used for successful

   included an examination of the public attention to and perceived
   credibility of mass media food safety information and the perceived risk
   as background factors in the extended TPB model to predict public
   intention to take precautions to avoid consuming foods with additives.
   The empirical results of structural equation modeling analysis with 487
   useful samples revealed that the extended TPB model has an increased
   explanatory power relative to the original model regarding the intention
   of the public in Taiwan to take precautions to avoid consuming foods
   that contain additives. In addition to attitudes toward and perceived
   behavioral control of the consumption of food with additives, the impact
   of risk perceptions plays an important role in determining an
   individual's intention to take precautions to avoid consuming foods that
   contain additives. The attention of an individual to food additive
   scandal news and their perceived risk determine their attitude toward
   consuming food with additives. An individual's perceived risk of
   consuming food with additives was determined through the attention paid
   to food additive scandal news and the perceived credibility of such
   news. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem is an optimization problem
   which contains infinitely many constraints of finitely many variables.
   To solve the semi-infinite programming problem, a nonmonotone filter
   trust region method is proposed in this paper. By reformulating the
   Karush- Kuhn-Tucker system of a nonlinear programming, we obtain a
   system of semismooth equations that is equivalent to the SIP problem.
   Also, the NCP function is used to construct the semismooth equations.
   For solving this equivalent problem, a promising method, called filter
   method, is introduced. Compared with the existed methods for SIP, the
   presented method is more flexible and has several advantages as follows:
   first, the penalty function is not needed, which is widely used in
   algorithms for solving nonlinear equations. Second, to avoid the trial
   point from falling into the ``valley{''}, the non-monotonic technique is
   added into the method. Moreover, there is only one system of linear
   equations needed to be solved at per iteration. Additional, based on the
   ODE-type method, the proposed nonmonotone filter method is more flexible
   than other traditional methods. And the scale of calculation is reduced
   to a certain degree. Under some reasonable conditions, the global
   convergent properties of the presented method are proven.}},

   paper, the e-commerce marketing and enterprise performance based on
   cloud platform were researched. On the basis of briefly introducing the
   relevant theories and techniques, the cloud platform cloud computing
   technology, e-commerce marketing and performance, CRM service technology
   and trust value calculation method were introduced. And the e-commerce
   marketing and enterprise performance were discussed. Moreover, some
   technical methods used in enterprise e-commerce marketing and
   performance were summarized. The results showed that in the cloud
   platform, the calculation of enterprise e-marketing and performance
   should best use the CRM service technology and trust value calculation
   method, so that the marketing and performance data could be analyzed

Abstract = {{Increasingly, multi-stakeholder processes have been recognized as being
   necessary to the development of public policies seeking to promote
   systemic innovation in response to complex and multidimensional
   challenges, such as household food security, rural development, and
   environmental change. Saint Lucia, a small island developing state
   located in the Caribbean, has been grappling with a wide range of
   agriculture, food and nutrition security challenges with varying degrees

   paper explores the nature of the stakeholder interactions surrounding
   the development of Saint Lucia's 2009-2015 National Agricultural Policy

   participation levels, conflicting roles of different forms of social
   capital in the interactions between stakeholders, and missing
   ``boundary{''} organizations capable of facilitating a transition

Abstract = {{In the United Kingdom, blanket antibiotic dry cow therapy (BDCT) is
   commonly prescribed. An alternate strategy is selective dry cow therapy
   (SDCT) whereby a teat sealant is given instead of an antibiotic to cows
   with a low probability of infection. Switching from BDCT to SDCT can
   significantly reduce antibiotic use. The aims of this study were to
   explore how veterinarians (vets) rationalized their prescribing
   decisions for mammary treatments at drying off, and the barriers and
   motivators they perceived to implementing SDCT. Face-to-face interviews
   were conducted with 20 purposively recruited vets from 6 practices in
   England, United Kingdom. The data were analyzed qualitatively using an
   inductive thematic analysis. The majority of participants stated a
   personal preference for SDCT because it constitutes more responsible
   antibiotic use. On the majority of farms, the prescribing decision was
   taken by a senior veterinarian and BDCT was prescribed. Less experienced
   vets expressed a desire to be more involved in the decision-making
   process. The first theme, prioritizing responsible antimicrobial
   prescribing, encapsulated the difficulties vets expressed engaging with
   farmers, conflicts of interest, and vets' determination to take action.
   The second theme, the effect of a vet's experience on their ability to
   influence farmers, focused on the specific challenges faced by less
   experienced vets and the importance of vets being both trusted by
   farmers and being knowledgeable. The third theme, vets' perceptions
   about the risk and complexity of implementing SDCT, revealed markedly
   different levels of concern and fears about adverse outcomes with teat
   sealants versus antibiotics. The results also showed differences in
   perceptions about how difficult SDCT is to implement in practice. The
   last theme, vets' suggestions for facilitating the introduction of SDCT,
   was wide ranging and provided useful insight from a veterinary
   perspective into ways to facilitate SDCT. Initiatives that seek to alter
   vets' perceptions of the risks associated with switching to using SDCT
   are likely to prove useful in facilitating change. Our results also
   suggest that it is vital for senior vets to take a leading role in
   facilitating farms to implement SDCT. Less experienced colleagues may
   benefit from more help from senior vets to gain the trust of farmers and
   to become involved more quickly in herd-level preventive medicine. Vets
   must work together and take a united approach to reduce antimicrobial
   use.}},

Abstract = {{In the current era, food chains are becoming increasingly complex and
   consumer concerns about food safety are growing. As a result, consumers
   tend to rely heavily on chain actors to ensure the quality of the
   products they consume, Given this background, this study was conducted
   with a view to understanding the level of consumers' trust in vegetable
   supply chain members and how trust influences the consumers' behavioural
   responses. This paper is based on data obtained from 854 respondents in
   south-west Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The results revealed that
   the level of trust placed in chain members varied across the chain.
   Respondents considered that domestic producers are more trustworthy in
   terms of producing safer vegetables and the lowest trust level was
   associated with imported vegetables. Gender, household size, years of
   stay in Australia, trust perceptions, and country of origin concerns had
   a significant influence on the respondents' intentions to pay a premium
   price for domestically produced vegetables. The study revealed that
   consumers respond to food safety concerns and this creates an
   opportunity for the vegetable industry to respond to these concerns. (C)

Abstract = {{With the increased popularity of organic food production, new
   information about the risks attached to food products has become
   available. Consumers need to make sense of this information, interpret
   the information in terms of risks and benefits, and consequently choose
   whether to buy these products or not. In this study, we examined how
   social media mediated interaction with another person impacts risk
   perception and sense-making regarding eating organic food. Specifically,
   we investigated how risk perception and sense-making are influenced by
   the specific message frame, the identity of the conversation partner,
   the perceived similarity and expertise of this partner, and the initial
   attitude of individuals. An online interaction experiment, including a
   simulated chat in which we manipulated the message frame (gains vs
   losses vs uncertainty) and the conversation partner (expert vs peer vs
   anonymous) was conducted using a representative sample of Dutch internet
   users (n = 310). Results showed that chatting with partners who were
   perceived to be expert was associated with lower levels of risk
   perception, while chatting with partners who were perceived to be
   similar was associated with higher levels of information need, intention
   to take notice, and search for and share information. Results also
   showed that initial attitude had a strong effect. The more positive
   consumers were about eating organic food, the lower their risk
   perception and the higher their need for information, intention to take
   notice of, search for and share information following the chat.
   Implications for authorities communicating on food (risks) are
   discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The increased consumers' interest in high quality foods with fresh-like
   sensory and additive free attributes led to the development of
   non-thermal food processing technologies as alterative to conventionally
   heat treatments. This review describes the current application status
   and market trends of high-pressure processing (HPP) technology in food
   industry. As the most successfully commercialized non-thermal processing
   technology, HPP eliminates food pathogens at room temperature and
   extends the shelf life of foods circulated through the cold chain. These
   processes maintain the organoleptic properties and nutritional value of
   the foods, which is not possible using traditional thermal
   pasteurization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has officially
   approved HPP as a non-thermal pasteurization technology that can replace
   traditional pasteurization in the food industry. Clearly defined
   regulations and specifications will facilitate the development of the
   application market to improve product quality and consumer trust. The
   widespread application of HPP technology has boosted the development and
   market demand for HPP equipment. HPP has been widely used in the
   production of packaged vegetables, fruits, meat, seafood, and dairy
   products. By the end of 2015, more than 300 units of HPP equipment were
   operating globally. Despite the high price and high barriers to
   investment, the specialized original equipment manufacturer service
   sector has been gradually increasing, and the annual output value of
   global HPP market has approached \$10 billion. HPP technology also can
   be combined with existing food trends, as organic food, health food or
   clean label to boost the development in the food market. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In order to prevent food safety incidents from becoming a crisis, a good
   crisis management structure is essential. The aim of the current study
   was to compare and evaluate the national food incident response plans of
   2 neighboring EU Member States: Germany and the Netherlands. This
   revealed that the structure of these plans is comparable, starting with
   initial alerting, assessment of the problem, upscaling, an execution
   phase and finally an evaluation of the crisis management. However, the
   German communication structure is more complex than the Dutch one and
   cross-border communication between both countries is currently limited.
   In general, the presence of national response plans does not guarantee a
   good and swift response to a food safety incident as this is often
   hampered by difficulties in tracing the source of the problem as well as
   difficulties in communication between organizations involved in crisis
   management. A timely detection can be improved through the development
   of fast screening and detecting systems and through combining various
   data sources using computer software systems. Mutual cooperation and
   communication can be improved through joint exercises or projects. This
   will help to streamline communication toward consumers and trade
   partners. Such communication should be transparent relaying not only the
   facts but also the uncertainties in a crisis in order to gain consumer
   trust and safeguard international trade.}},

Abstract = {{Spurred by the demand for efficient solutions that help to overcome
   increasing challenges in agricultural practices, food quality and
   supply, and nutritional health and pushed by new technologies appearing
   on the horizon, the field of agriculture and food chemistry is evolving
   more rapidly than ever before. At the same time, the landscape of
   scientific publishing is in a transition with new journals sprouting,
   many of them miniaturized in scope or limited by a narrow readership. In
   comparison, the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (JAFC),
   established 65 years ago, is firmly rooted in a long tradition of
   publication excellence in the broader chemistry and biotechnology of
   agricultural and biobased materials all the way up to food products
   including bioactivity, nutritional, and health aspects. To sustain JAFC
   as a most trusted partner in the field, in 2017 we are going to further
   professionalize our editorial work and leverage the potential of our
   international Editorial Advisory Board (EAB) members who provide outside
   reflections from authors and share new perspectives for the Journal's
   overall agenda and strategy. We are also going to enhance the visibility
   of our most outstanding scientific work and better support and highlight

Title = {{Nutrition label experience and consumption of transitional foods among a

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{425-439}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the usefulness of
   nutrition labels in Thailand during nutrition transition from
   traditional to modern diets that increase salt, sugar, and calorie
   intake and to note socio-demographic interactions and associations with
   consumption of transitional processed foods.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors studied 42,750 distance
   learning Open University adults aged 23-96 years in 2013 residing
   nationwide and participating in an ongoing community-based prospective
   cohort study. The authors used multivariable logistic regression to
   relate nutrition label experiences ({''}read{''}, ``good understand{''},
   ``frequent use{''}), socio-demographic factors, and consumption of four
   transitional foods. These foods included ``unhealthy{''} instant foods,
   carbonated soft drinks, and sweet drinks, or ``healthy{''} milk.
   Findings - Overall, two-thirds reported good understanding and frequent
   use of nutrition labels. Unhealthy transition-indicator processed foods
   were frequently consumed: instant foods (7 per cent), (carbonated) soft
   drinks (15 per cent), and sweet drinks (41 per cent). Frequent users of
   nutrition labels (e.g. females, older persons, professionals) were less
   likely to consume unhealthy indicator foods. Those with the most
   positive overall nutrition label experience ({''}read{''} + ``good
   understanding{''} + ``frequent use{''}) had the best indicator food
   profiles: instant foods (odds ratio (OR) 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.56-0.70); soft
   drinks (OR 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.61); sweet drinks (OR 0.79; 95\% CI,
   0.74-0.85); milk (OR 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.74-2.00).
   Originality/value - Knowledge protected - those with most nutrition
   label experience were least likely to consume unhealthy foods. Results
   support government regulated nutrition labels, expanding to include
   sweet drinks. The study is remarkable for its large size and nationwide
   footprint. Study subjects were educated, represent Thais of the future,
   and show high awareness of transition-indicator foods.}},

Title = {{The role of social media in communication about food risks}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{453-467}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the views of
   journalists, food regulators and the food industry representatives on
   the impact of social media on communication about food risk. The authors
   identify how journalists/media actors use social media in identifying
   and creating news stories arguing that food regulators need to maintain
   a social media presence to ensure that accurate information about food
   safety is disseminated via social media.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through 105
   semi-structured interviews.
   Findings - While food regulators and representatives of the food
   industry identify advantages of social media including two-way
   communication and speed of transmission of information, they maintain
   concerns about information provided via social media fearing the
   potential for loss of control of the information and sensationalism.
   There is evidence, however, that media actors use social media to
   identify food stories, to find sources, gauge public opinion and to
   provide a human interest angle.
   Practical implications - While there are commonalities between the three
   groups, concerns with social media reflect professional roles. Food
   regulators need to be aware of how media actors use social media and
   maintain a social media presence. Further, they need to monitor other
   sources to maintain consumer trust.
   Originality/ value - This paper adds to public debate through comparing
   the perspectives of the three groups of respondents each that have their
   own agendas which impact how they interact with and use social media.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the dimensions of
   experiential quality and examining the interrelationships among
   experiential quality, experiential satisfaction, perceived value,
   experiential trust and experiential loyalty using a multi-dimensional
   and hierarchical model as a framework perceived by coffee chain
   customers.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study were based on
   a sample of 428 customers at Starbucks in Taipei City of Taiwan. Data
   were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor
   analysis.
   Findings - The findings reveal that there are four primary dimensions
   and 13 sub-dimensions of experiential quality in a coffee chain. In
   addition, the results indicate that affective quality is identified as
   the most primary dimension of experiential quality perceived by coffee
   chain customers. Experiential quality significantly influences perceived
   value and experiential trust, respectively. Also, experiential
   satisfaction is influenced by perceived value, experiential quality and
   experiential trust. Furthermore, experiential satisfaction and
   experiential trust are determinants of experiential loyalty.
   Originality/value - This is the first study identifying experiential
   quality, experiential satisfaction, perceived value, experiential trust
   and experiential loyalty in the context of coffee chains.}},

Title = {{Food safety compliance approaches Case study of a primary authority
   partnership between EH Booths Ltd and Preston City Council}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{744-758}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This case study follows the history of the personal and
   experiences, viewpoints, and attitudes of the key actors from both
   parties over the period of setting up and implementing a primary
   authority partnership. It is one of a series research papers and case
   studies that study approaches to improve compliance with public and
   private regulations through cooperative and collaborative approaches.
   The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - It is a grounded qualitative study of what
   a number of individuals said in the course of a number of interviews.
   The aim and objectives being to obtain, from the key actors, their
   personal viewpoints, attitudes to and experiences of the partnership.
   Unlike some grounded approaches the research was based on the priori
   themes of cooperation and collaboration using semi structured
   interviews. At one stage, because of difficulty of access to the key
   actors caused by major re-development of the company, questionnaires
   replaced interviews.
   Findings - The authors found that barriers to achieving a successful
   partnership included an initial reluctance, by all parties concerned, to
   cede some of their management autonomy to others and experiences of
   uncooperative behaviour between the public and private sectors in the
   past. They were largely overcome as the implementation of the project
   progressed resulting in improved food safety compliance management based
   on mutual trust. Other benefits for Preston City Council were immediate
   cost savings for Preston City Council in their use of human resources.
   For E.H. Booths, Ltd no initial cost saving was made, but there is
   potential longer term savings to be made through better risk based
   targeting of resources. These benefits only being made possible by the
   collaborative effort and support from all parties and individuals
   involved.
   Originality/value - On its own this case study research is limited by
   its size and scope but the emerging topics and findings highlight the
   difficulties and barriers faced in setting up partnerships between
   public regulators and businesses. Therefore, the results can be of value
   to similar studies and other areas where cooperation, collaboration,
   partnership, and co-regulation are significant contributory factors to
   successful compliance strategies.}},

Title = {{Influence of online product presentation on consumers' trust in organic
   food A mediated moderation model}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2724-2739}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Against the background of industrialisation and modernisation
   of agriculture, food production issues and environmental hazards have
   become more and more obvious and consumers are increasingly concerned
   about food safety and health, which is strengthening demand for organic
   food. E-commerce provides a new channel for sales. Research on consumer
   trust in online organic food sales is the basis of network marketing.
   The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A laboratory experiment was used to
   empirically test the effects of media richness on consumers' trust and
   the moderating effect of online review length. A 2 x 2 factorial design
   (i.e. two types of online product presentation formats (between-subject)
   x two levels of online review lengths (between-subject)) was used.
   Findings - Media richness has a significant positive effect on
   consumers' trust and that this effect is moderated by online review
   length. Meanwhile, perceived risk conveys the interaction effect of the
   media richness of online product presentation and online review length
   to trust.
   Practical implications - E-commerce websites should aim to promote
   organic food by using a variety of online product presentation formats
   and by presenting high quality online reviews in order to reduce
   consumers' perceived risk and improve their degree of trust when buying
   online.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a new insight into consumers'
   attitude of buying organic food online. The results of the research
   could provide proposals for promoting organic food sales online.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a considerable systemic metabolic disorder to
   exhibit various metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, mainly
   hyperglycemia. The global projected estimate of diabetes in 2030 will be
   about 439million adults, out of which 300million expected are of type-2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present knowledge revealed responsible
   factors, occurrence and mechanism of these factors involved in the DM
   diseases. Hence, the aim of this review is to address and summarize the
   causes, plant resources, importance, present status and future
   programmes for diabetes control. The present review answers the
   contemporary present questions raised in the scientific field on DM. Two
   major problems are explained in detail about the autoimmune attack or
   dysfunction of -cell and insulin resistance involved for Type 1 and Type
   2 DM, respectively. Though there are various approaches to reduce the
   ill effects of diabetes and its secondary complications, many preferred
   herbal formulations due to lesser side effects and low cost. For this
   reason still it is getting increased attention in searching antidiabetic
   medicinal plants for hot research and to develop targeted medicine.
   Recurrence of islet autoimmunity lesson from pancreatic islet cell
   transplantation to cure T1D was outlined. With these highlights, the
   review summarizes the current knowledge on diabetes occurrence, factors
   (environmental and genetics), and types (I, II, gestation, and secondary
   DM), antidiabetic plants, sources for insulin mimetic plant principle
   compounds and their target mechanism with current and future trusted
   research areas for controlling of DM.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Stakeholders' Expectations for Dairy Sector Development
   Strategies from a Central-Eastern and Western European Perspective}},
Journal = {{GERMAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},

Pages = {{265-280}},
Abstract = {{The development paths chosen by farmers and the critical success factors
   involved can be better understood when the business context in which
   these farmers operate is known. Also, interaction in the chain
   contributes to the strength of the chain. This raises questions such as
   do chain parties cooperate and is there a certain consensus concerning
   the future strategic route? This article provides a unique analysis of
   how stakeholders envisage the future of dairy farming in a period of
   radical policy change and what barriers they foresee to their
   objectives. The questionnaire used examined perceptions on development
   strategies, availability of resources, opportunities \& threats (O\& T),
   farmer skills and future expectations. In 2015 and early 2016, a total
   of 161 completed questionnaires were collected from stakeholders
   (leading persons in the dairy chain) in the Netherlands, Slovenia,
   Lithuania and Poland. Data were analysed by PCA, ANOVA, cluster and
   stepwise regression methods. Eight strategic clusters of stakeholders
   were found. Farm expansion and specialisation was the most expected
   development strategy (57\% of stakeholders). Almost one fourth of the
   stakeholders took a wait and see approach, of which 15\% looked for
   opportunities to activate at a particular moment in time, while 8\% were
   generally pessimistic about the future. Diversification in combination
   with organic farming was chosen by 5\% of the stakeholders, 10\% of
   stakeholders focused on cooperation, service and high tech, and another
   5\% placed their trust in skills, subsidies and labour. The opinions of
   stakeholders were highly affected by the country of origin, while only
   minor variations in opinions were observed between different categories
   of stakeholders. Polish stakeholders showed the most specialised view on
   the dairy chain, but they scored relatively low on cooperation.
   Development towards diversification and organic agriculture received
   higher scores in Slovenia and Lithuania compared to the Netherlands and
   especially to Poland. Netherlands' stakeholders were the most positive
   about the future e.g. they foresee expansion and market opportunities.
   It was shown that strategies, resources and O\& T each directly affect
   future expectations, which was in agreement with the hypothetical model
   used.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{201-219}},
Abstract = {{Drawing inspiration from American institutionalism and new institutional
   economics, this paper discusses the rise of large corporate farms as the
   transition from the classic capitalist firm to the corporate form of
   organization based on the separation of ownership and control. Three
   case studies from the Brazilian cerrado show the rise of large corporate
   farms to be enabled and impelled by the advance of agricultural
   production technologies and the search for scale economies. The key
   finding from the case studies is that complex technology not only
   necessitates large-scale farming but also generates technical and
   organizational solutions to the potentially pervasive agency problems.
   In addition to the use of sound corporate governance practices, these
   solutions include organizational architecture encompassing
   computer-aided accounting and budgeting systems, incentive-based
   compensation, clear definition of performance goals, and delegation of
   operational decisions to farm managers. Furthermore, organizational
   architecture has been shown to promote a culture of trust and
   accountability, which counteract the opportunistic tendencies of farm
   managers and workers.}},

Abstract = {{The internet has produced a forward-looking shift in the way we
   communicate, think and run economic activities around the globe. The
   revolution in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has
   generated an innovating process in the agri-food sector that is far from
   being unwind. The wine industry is a case in point. Indeed, the industry
   has attempted to address the multifaceted challenges posed by electronic
   commerce since always. Business to business electronic commerce has been
   slower to develop than its counterpart, i.e. business to consumer
   E-commerce. However business to business e-commerce is starting to
   attract an increased interest, by showing a significant business value
   in terms of potential. Against this background, the slow development of
   B2B e-commerce has been linked to regulatory and economic reasons. In
   order to deal with such stumbling blocks, the paper suggests a shift
   towards an open platform that is aimed at facilitating transactions and
   interactions among businesses through a continuous problem-solving
   process in which trust and value is co-created by producers and
   customers through relational contracting.}},

Abstract = {{Building on transaction cost economics theoretical framework, we
   examined the determinants of long-term business relationships between
   farmers and buyers in the Albanian dairy chain in a context
   characterised by weak institutions and lack of formal contract. Logistic
   regression analysis was employed to test the model on primary data
   collected from a sample of 315 Albanian farmers engaged in the
   production of sheep and goat milk. The study results support our
   hypotheses that trust, uncertainty and investment in specific assets are
   key determinants of long-term relationships. Implications at managerial
   and policy-making levels are discussed. At a managerial level, dairy
   owners and managers need to build trust with farmers and mitigate
   uncertainties as a precondition for long-term relationships. At the
   policy level, the government subsidy schemes need to be further refined
   in order to motivate farmers to increase flock size and strengthen
   vertical relationships in the dairy value chain, the latter being a
   precondition also to achieve traceability and improve standards.}},

Abstract = {{The article deals with the implementation of the LEADER programme in
   Poland. The aim of the paper was to present the influence of the LEADER
   programme 2007 - 2013 on rural areas development taking into account its
   objectives. This topic is current in the context of the Rural
   Development Programme 2007 - 2013 evaluation and search for effective
   tools for supporting rural areas. The results of research conducted in
   2016 among residents and local action groups are presented. Firstly, the
   LEADER programme had little impact on the possibility of finding work
   outside the agriculture. Secondly, the realized projects have
   contributed to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents
   in rural areas, especially when it comes to meeting the needs of tourism
   and leisure. The programme was of great importance in underpinning
   social capital in the countryside, especially its behavioral and bonding
   dimension. It is very significant taking into account the low level of
   social capital in rural areas in Poland. An overall level of activity of
   rural residents and other entities increased, so as the propensity to
   engage in joint initiatives and the level of trust. The observed effects
   of the LEADER programme may in the future contribute significantly to
   the endogenous development of rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{In the regions of Latvia there still exists a large unused resource
   -social capital (SC). Ineffectively implemented development policies,
   population's alienation from the state democratic institutions, a low
   level of non-governmental engagement and SC, lack of resources in the
   local government sector, increased emigration, civic cynicism, low
   conditions of the prestige of the political profession have facilitated
   the development differences among territories. The research goal:
   comparison of the social capital of Zemgale region, towns and districts.
   Monographic analysis and method of synthesis, data statistical research
   methods - grouping, comparison, the processing and interpretation of
   statistical data - the method for analyzing aggregate indicators, was
   used in the article. The research discovers the SC at the micro-level -
   the collaboration and attitudes between citizens and the state as well
   as in-between the individuals themselves, along with the macro-level
   -interaction of social groups as a part of a network which helps create
   trust to local government bodies as well as the state. The study
   indicates that the development of the Zemgale region is impacted not
   only by such social capital factors as the population density in the
   districts (0.37), the number of population until the working age (0.55),
   but also by the factor education level of the deputies (2009-2013)
   between the districts (0.12), towns (0.41), and the whole region (0.14).
   This verified the assumption that higher education level implies higher
   social potential and more active social inclusion. The authors suggest
   the local-governments to devote increased funding to the NGOs as it is
   the most active form of social capital, thus ensuring a long-term
   development of such initiative groups.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the association between
   socio-demographic variable and attitudes of respondents from Serbia and
   Croatia towards organic food. Consumers around the world have a positive
   attitude towards organic food without particular differences between
   various socio-demographic variables. However, the level of organic food
   consumption is low - organic farming covers 1\% of agricultural land.
   High price and low income of respondents represent the basic limiting
   factors. The economic factor is especially important for the markets of
   Serbia and Croatia. Also, a lack of information and trust in the organic
   production and organic certificates constitute part of the decision in
   purchase. Therefore, manufactures of organic products needs marketing
   activities to build a recognizable brand and develop trust among
   consumers. Also, consumers have shown a high degree of self-awareness in
   making decisions about the purchase of organic products, which makes

Abstract = {{Social cohesion (SC) is not much of a debatable topic in the developing

   social cohesion(SC) in rural areas using possible indicators that could
   contribute to the welfare of the rural populace. Data were drawn from
   the Nigeria General Household Survey 2012/2013 derived from the World
   Bank Living Standard Survey Measurement. Using exploratory factor
   analysis and Pearson correlation techniques to measure and test the
   multidimensionality of SC and its relation to rural welfare
   respectively, the results showed that about 46.5\% and 36.6\% have a
   perception that social trust and violence level is better in Nigeria,
   however only 36\% have access to rural communal resource. Policy focus
   should be targeted towards development of the rural social sector by
   redefining funding, institutional structures and functions.}},

Title = {{Adolescents' trust in food messages and their sources}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2712-2723}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The authors used role-playing with subsequent focus group
   interviews in order to explore how adolescents negotiate conflicting
   food messages they encounter in their everyday lives. The purpose of
   this paper is to describe adolescents' perceptions about different
   messages and their sources and to explore the trust they place in such
   sources.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 31 adolescents aged 15-16 years
   participated in role-playing with subsequent focus group interviews. A
   qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data.
   Findings - The adolescents depicted an everyday life with multiple and
   different messages about food and eating. In addition, they stated that
   these messages were conveyed by a wide range of sources at different
   levels, for example, by parents, teachers, sports coaches and media. The
   messages from different sources were conflicting and covered many
   different perspectives on food and eating. When negotiating food choices
   in the role-playing and in the focus group discussing how to handle
   different and conflicting messages, trust became visible. The
   trustworthiness of messages and trust in their sources were associated
   with several important aspects in regard to whether or not the messages
   were based on knowledge about food and nutrition, care for the person
   receiving the messages, and/or commercial interest. In addition, the
   results indicate that the situation and the social relationship to the
   person providing the message were of importance for trustworthiness.
   Originality/value - This study is novel as it uses role-playing as a
   research method and describes the trust adolescents place on food
   messages and their sources. To understand the factors that enhance such
   trust is important for the development and provision of education,
   information, and other health-promotion activities related to food in
   order to support and strengthen adolescents' critical reflections on
   food messages from different sources.}},

Title = {{The empirical model of trust, loyalty, and business performance of the
   dairy milk supply chain A comparative study}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2765-2787}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the
   relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence,
   price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data used in this study were primary data
   which were collected through personal interviews and closed
   questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The
   sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy
   cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and
   Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The
   study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software
   program to analyze the hypothesis.
   Findings - The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative
   communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect
   on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power
   dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java
   Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty
   for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier
   loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province,
   whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not
   significant effect on business performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is
   related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a
   business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship
   between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of
   cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future
   research may replicate this study in another region or in the other
   contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a
   producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of
   business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of
   financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the
   scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative.
   Practical implications - It is recommended that managers of dairy
   cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions
   especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As
   organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining
   the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation
   is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of
   milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and
   accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy
   cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value
   of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will
   maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is
   better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a
   marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative
   which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product.
   Social implications - The research confirms that individual dairy
   farmer's loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may
   encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the
   individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of
   their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives
   would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from
   the loyal dairy farmer.
   Originality/value - Although this research used the conceptual model
   from the previous study, this research will make some improvement.
   First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the
   construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader
   since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely,
   Central Java Province and West Java Province.}},

Pages = {{673-688}},
Abstract = {{A survey was administered to 183 Ugandan farmers in August 2014 to
   assess the factors that influence their willingness to become members of
   a proposed new agricultural cooperative. In particular, we were
   interested in a better understanding of how farmers viewed the social
   benefits associated with cooperation. These social benefits have the
   potential to become valuable sources of social capital. Four valid and
   reliable measures of social benefits were identified. Social benefits
   that farmers may use to get by (bonding networks) had two dimensions:
   emotional support and social support. Social benefits that farmers may
   use to get ahead (bridging networks) also had two dimensions: tangible
   and intangible resource sharing. The desire to gain these social
   benefits from cooperation (except for emotional support) emerged as
   strong predictors of farmers' willingness to cooperate in a proposed new
   agricultural cooperative. Surprisingly, the expected economic benefits
   of cooperation did not have a significant effect on willingness to
   cooperate. Implications and suggestions for future research and
   cooperative development and management are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates how a bottom-up agricultural development
   project, rooted in the practices of the smallholders and their (local)

   afterwards. An approach was investigated to implement more sustainable
   coffee production at the local level in Indonesia - the Mediated
   Partnership Model (Motramed). We conceptualize this model, initiated by
   an Indonesian research institute, as a form of collaborative governance
   to create a new, more sustainable management practice. We particularly
   focus on four critical mechanisms in the partnering process: defining a
   common problem, building trust, exploring collaborative advantages, and
   establishing a leadership role. Empirical research was conducted in
   three regions: Bali, Flores, and Java. In conclusion, we define several
   critical factors that need to be addressed to further develop similar
   bottom-up partnerships for more varied agricultural commodities.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of power on
   supply chain performance (SCP) in the context of small and medium sized
   agribusiness enterprises (SMEs). Contrary to most of previous studies,
   which collect and analyze data from one side of a relationship dyad
   using a focal firm approach, a matched triad approach was employed in
   data collection and analysis.
   Design/methodology/approach - Empirical data was collected from 150
   agribusiness supply chain members from the maize supply chain in Uganda.
   Analysis was done using multi-group analysis and structural equations
   modeling.
   Findings - Results highlight the differences in the perception of power
   use and how it influences SCP. The differences in perception suggest the
   existence of power asymmetry amongst supply chain members. This work
   contributes to the ongoing debate concerning the use of triad as a unit
   of analysis as opposed to a firm or a dyad.
   Research limitations/implications - This study only focused on one
   commodity chain in one country, which can limit the broad application of
   the findings.
   Originality/value - The novelty of this work lies in fact that the
   authors assess perception of power amongst supply chain members in a
   triadic context, a perspective that has not been adequately tested in
   agribusiness supply chain management studies before.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the technical efficiency of the agribusiness poultry
   entrepreneurs in Abia state. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted
   in selecting 180 poultry farmers. An estimated gamma value (gamma) of
   42.11\% was highly significant at 1\% level of probability implying that
   42.11\% of random variation in the output of the poultry entrepreneurs
   was due to the inefficiency in their respective farms and not as a
   result of random variability. Feed and drugs/vaccines were positively
   related to output of the poultry operators respectively while labour
   input and capital inputs were negatively related to output of the
   poultry. The average poultry operators were able to obtain 81\% of
   potential output from a given mixture of production inputs. Age and
   credit access negatively influenced the technical efficiency of the
   poultry entrepreneurs while stock size, business experience and level of
   education positively affected efficiency of the entrepreneurs.
   Insufficient funds and theft were the major problems affecting poultry
   farming in the study area. Efforts to reducing the costs incurred on
   fixed items by these entrepreneurs should be encouraged such as
   provision of timely loans and credits by banks to reduce time lag in
   production cycles. Credits inform of stocks, feeds and drugs/vaccines
   from trusted sources will boost productivity, efficiency and income with

Title = {{Trust in ag-related marketing claims: a segmentation with German
   consumers}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1999-2012}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Agricultural-related food marketing claims are gaining in
   importance. The challenge for the industry is to claim real production
   characteristics while being in line with consumers' expectations.
   Looking at the example of marketing pasture-raised milk year-round and
   the fact that cows only have access to pasture in summer, the purpose of
   this paper is to analyse consumer expectations, the potential of
   deception and the acceptance of more credible marketing strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - An online access panel was used for data
   collection. The data include 310 German milk buyers, who were grouped
   using cluster analysis to examine the different target groups for the
   year-round and seasonal marketing of pasture-raised milk.
   Findings - The study distinguished two different consumer groups: one
   with lower expectations accepting year-round marketing (32.5 per cent)
   and the other with higher demands, who feel deceived by year-round
   marketing (46.7 per cent). Furthermore, one part of the last group is
   also sceptical towards the more precise seasonal marketing due to their
   general scepticism towards ag-related marketing claims.
   Practical implications - To generate consumer trust in ag-related
   marketing claims, it is beneficial to meet consumers' expectations.
   Producers have to decide if they orient their products to more modest or
   more critical consumer segments. While it is easier to implement lower
   standards, there is the risk to disappoint (and thereby lose) the most
   interesting target group of highly involved consumers characterised by
   some general doubts regarding food marketing claims.
   Originality/value - The study is the first to demonstrate the existence
   of two consumer segments that differ in their expectations towards and
   acceptance of ag-related marketing claims for food products.}},

Title = {{Value appropriation in Brazilian cattle industry}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2089-2101}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the influencing
   factors on cattle breeders' payment system choices using cross-sectional
   data collected in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio
   Grande do Sul. The investigation aims to analyze the problem of value
   appropriation comparing the payment based on carcass index with live
   weight mode under the perspective of ``bovine for slaughtering{''} as a
   multidimensional product with various attributes.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a generalized order
   logistic regression model in a survey with 69 cattle breeders' interview
   to conduct the empirical analysis.
   Findings - The empirical results show that measurement difficulties and
   collective actions influence farmers' choice to a less efficient payment
   system in quality terms and value appropriation problems, while the
   trust level in the slaughterhouse pushes to a more efficient system.
   Furthermore, trust was presented as more important than technological
   aspects and long-time relationship as well as collective action
   corroborates to increase bargaining power and to solve conflicts. In
   sum, trust, measurement and bargaining power brought traditional and
   alternative solutions to solve conflicts such as well-designed payment
   indicators, collective actions and transaction costs.
   Originality/value - This study used first-hand survey and proxy
   variables on cattle farmers' payment system choices. Another
   contribution is the focus on two regions with two different payment
   systems in the same institutional environment in a way to suggest
   mechanisms of private strategies and public policy to reduce
   opportunistic value appropriation as well as decreasing conflict.}},

Abstract = {{With the shortcomings of pure software security protection, the embedded
   trusted security model (ETSM) trusted computing platform framework is
   proposed. This framework is based on trusted computing technology and
   the interface specification of the national trusted cryptography module
   (TCM). Based on the core content of the trusted computing key management
   method, this paper proposes a key management architecture based on ETSM,
   implementing functions such as the encryption algorithm (or
   cryptographic engine), the generation of key management function, and
   random key into the ETSM hardware environment. The basic management
   function of the ETSM key management architecture is designed and
   implemented; dual port key buffer management and the external key
   storage management scheme are provided. Independent of the ETSM module
   and the PC host, a heterogeneous dual processor system, PC via PCI
   interface and ETSM communication cam rapidly complete sensitive data
   encryption and decryption and save nonvolatile memory and related keys
   to ETSM. These functions ensure encryption security, improve the
   credibility of the heterogeneous system, and meet trusted computing
   platform integrity and safety requirements. This paper focuses on the
   key management mechanism of trusted computing and the key algorithm of
   trusted platform. First, trusted computing and trusted computing modules
   are introduced, followed by the importance of a trusted computing
   module. The key management mechanism in trusted computing and the
   original management mechanism are analyzed to propose a new mechanism.
   Finally, the two algorithms used in the study are studied, with one
   finding the inversed algorithm and the other the generation algorithm.
   After improvements, a more efficient algorithm is formulated via
   theoretical verification and data analysis. The algorithm runs faster,
   consumes less memory, and performs efficiently when solving problems on
   the existing platform, and it can also improve the operational
   efficiency in terms of overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Local production supports the economies of place and increasingly makes
   sense as the citizen-consumers increase in number and awareness.
   Nonetheless, despite the value of the short supply chains, some
   researchers have reacted sceptically to the irrational optimism around
   this sales structure. A close relationship with consumers does not imply
   more profit or exchange fairness by definition. In fact, increasing
   marketing costs must be considered and there is still information
   asymmetry, and the profiteering farmers could take advantage of the
   consumer trust. Through data reduction we explored the farmers'
   motivation and perceived effects of participating in short food supply
   chains. We also analysed the location of farms along with their size,
   production, sale channels and the relative market share, as well as
   whether they adopted quality certifications. We found that the farmers
   that work within the short food supply chains opt for a sort of
   co-certification mechanism based on the consumer/producer relationships
   rather than opting for the quality certification. Furthermore, the
   multivariate analysis showed different motivations and perceptions of
   direct sales among farmers: those that were the largest and farthest
   from the point of sale, were positive toward the social values of short
   food supply chains, while the rest seemed less competitive and were more
   motivated by profit and survival. The results reaffirm that the local
   production may not be good per se, and the presence of profit and
   surviving-orientation to market should be considered a treat especially
   for the reputation of the whole system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses governance structures in Uganda's smallholder pig
   value chains by applying the New Institutional Economics framework. It
   utilises cross sectional and qualitative survey data from randomly
   selected pig value chain actors in 4 districts. A multinomial logit
   model is applied to assess the determinants of vertical integration
   among pig traders. The findings indicate that most relationships at the
   pig production node of the value chain are based on spot market
   governance structures supported by personal relationships and trust.
   Live pig traders are mostly vertically integrated. High integration
   levels of the pig traders are positively influenced by access to market
   information, value of investments in the value chain, and dedicated
   asset specificity in terms of backyard slaughter premises. Upgrading
   opportunities in the value chain in the form of value addition
   strategies, policy implementation and promotion of business models that
   link producer organisations to quality inputs and service suppliers
   through contractual arrangements are identified.}},

   acceptance by Malaysian consumers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{365-378}},
Abstract = {{Expectations of exporting food and agricultural product to Malaysia have
   been substantially growing in Japan. Although Japan has two halal
   certification bodies recognized by Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia
   (JAKIM), it is unclear whether Malaysian consumers trust its certified
   processed foods. Thus, this study aims to clarify Malaysian consumers'
   preference for Hokkaido ice cream by conducting a conjoint analysis. The
   results show no significant difference in the level of consumer trust in
   halal certifications, indicating a distribution based on both Malaysian
   and Japanese certification bodies. Therefore, it is possible that
   Malaysian consumers would accept Japanese products with a halal
   certification approved by JAKIM. In addition, the willingness to pay for
   Hokkaido ice cream reported a high satisfaction value. However, there is
   no significant effect on food functionality possibly because Malaysian
   consumers' awareness of the health benefits remains low.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},

Pages = {{379-399}},
Abstract = {{Several food crises damaged the image of the agricultural sector and
   consumers have lost trust, especially in animal production practices.
   Large parts of society believe that animal welfare standards in
   livestock production need to be improved. As a result, numerous animal
   welfare products have emerged on the market. This consumer paper
   identifies five clusters and, thus, strategic groups for the purchase of
   animal welfare products within the large group of consumers that differ
   significantly in their attitudes towards modern agriculture, their
   perception of animal welfare, their social acceptance of meat
   consumption and their shopping behaviour. Even personal differences are
   found between the clusters. Based on the results, we derived specific
   marketing implications for each cluster. These implications can help to
   develop a more differentiated market segment for animal welfare products
   in terms of animal welfare level and required price premium, enabling
   consumers to make product choices according to their preferences.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{771-789}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to incorporate third-party
   certification to test a theoretical model that demonstrates the effects
   of third-party certification on perceived food quality, perceived
   service quality, and trust and the effects of these factors on word of
   mouth (WOM) intentions in the context of luxury restaurants. It also
   investigates the moderating roles of attention to social comparison
   information (ATSCI) and the education level.
   Design/methodology/approach - An online survey sent to customers who are
   patronizing luxury restaurants in the US 317 empirical data analysis was
   conducted using structural equation modeling.
   Findings - Third-party certification facilitated patrons' positive
   evaluation of food and service quality. In addition, this positive
   evaluation fostered trust in the restaurant. Finally, ATSCI and the
   education level had significant moderating effects on the relationship
   between third-party certification and patrons' trust in the restaurant.
   Originality/value - This study proposes risk-reducing effect of
   third-party certification on the luxury-restaurant business. Third-party
   certification is employed as a mechanism for communicating restaurant
   quality in food and service to patrons. Both stakeholders and patrons in
   the restaurant industry can obtain benefits from the third-party
   certification because it minimizes uncertainties and information
   asymmetries in luxury restaurants' quality and service, and thus
   generating likelihood of WOM intentions.}},

Title = {{Consumers' awareness and perceptions regarding functional dairy products
   in Iran A qualitative research}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{253-266}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Functional dairy products market has been growing steadily in
   Iran. Awareness and perception related to these products has an
   important role in consumers' acceptance and subsequently long-term
   marketplace success of these products. The purpose of this paper is to
   fill the knowledge gap in this regard, study conducted in Iran.
   Design/methodology/approach - The theory of social marketing served as
   the framework of the study. Qualitative data were collected via eight
   semi-structured focus group discussions (FGDs), between May and
   September 2014. Participants were 65 women (44 housewives and 21
   employed women), aged 23-68 years, selected by purposive sampling, with
   a maximum diversity. All FGDs were audio recorded and transcribed
   verbatim. Qualitative content analysis of the data was conducted by
   MAXQDA (R).
   Findings - Almost all participants were unfamiliar with the term
   ``functional dairy products,{''} although, some of them had consumed
   these products. Apart from perceiving the functional dairy products as
   unnecessary by some participants, some women did not trust in health
   claims of these products for various reasons such as distrust in food
   manufacturers, exposure to contradictory information, and fear of
   unforeseen and dangerous side effects due to taking them. The
   participants agreed on the need for more information from a trusted and
   credible source such as health professionals or authorities through
   different communication channels like television, training classes,
   shopping center, and so on.
   Originality/value - This study provides a unique insight into consumers'
   awareness and perceptions concerning functional dairy products in Iran.
   To the best of the knowledge, this study is the first study in this
   regard in Iran. Given the novelty of these products in the market, the
   findings could provide information for the dairy industry to expand its
   market and improve its profitability and reliability, as well as public
   health sector to design and implement intervention programs to promote
   functional dairy products consumption in the population.}},

   evidence from rural China}},
Journal = {{CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{48-61}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different
   types of the village relationship influence different types of public
   goods provision in rural China.
   Design/methodology/approach - The three components (clan-based
   relationship, neighborhood relationship and external relationship) were
   derived by employing factor analysis. The simultaneous discrete choice
   model was used to estimate the influence of these components on public
   goods provision, using the survey data from the China Household Income
   Project conducted in 2007.
   Findings - The findings indicate that considering different components
   of village relationship allows for a better understanding of the public
   good provision. The results indicate that the neighborhood relationship
   has a significantly positive effect on rural public goods provision,
   particularly on water conservancy and irrigation, while the external
   relationship has a significantly positive effect on all types of public
   goods.
   Practical implications - Local public goods provision is the core of the
   new rural construction in China. These findings imply that relationship
   in villages plays a vital role in the provision of public goods and is
   necessary in the construction of the new harmonious countryside in
   China. The results also have implications for rural public goods
   provision in other developing countries.
   Originality/value - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study to quantitatively model the impact of different relationships on
   public goods provision at the rural level. A consideration of the
   different components in village relationship allows for a more precise
   understanding of the pubic goods provision in the village.}},

Title = {{Food scares: a comprehensive categorisation}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{131-142}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a
   comprehensive categorisation of food scares.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following an initial desktop study, the
   categorisation was developed collaboratively with industry experts
   through a workshop and series of semi-structured interviews.
   Findings - The new categorisation developed is in Venn diagram format
   allowing overlapping categories. It is organised around the two major
   types of contamination (biological, and chemical/physical contaminants)
   and the two major causes of contamination (wilful deception, and
   transparency and awareness issues).
   Practical implications - The long and complex supply chains
   characteristic of current food production systems have resulted in a
   rising number of food scares. There is thus an increased emphasis on
   developing strategies to reduce both the number of incidents of food
   scares, and their associated economic, social and environmental impacts.
   The new categorisation developed in this study enables experts to
   address categories of food scares. Inclusion of the cause of
   contamination is particularly important as the method through which
   contamination occurs is key in devising food scare prevention
   strategies.
   Originality/value - The new categorisation, unlike previous
   categorisations, enables food scares to fall into multiple categories,
   as appropriate. Also, again in contrast to previous categorisations, it
   takes into account not only the physical problem of a food scare but
   also the mechanism through which it arises.}},

Title = {{The Sino-Brazilian beef supply chain: mapping and risk detection}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},

Pages = {{164-180}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The flow of the Sino-Brazilian frozen beef trade has
   intensified. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to characterize the
   supply chain structure, and identify its major fragilities.
   Design/methodology/approach - Supply chain mapping was conducted based
   on the existing literature and primary data collection. Key stakeholders
   were detected and questioned through semi-structured interviews, which
   were later interpreted with content analysis.
   Findings - The results reveal a low degree of chain coordination from
   the Brazilian farm to the Chinese consumer, arising from an immature
   traceability mechanism, a limited flow of reliable information between
   the segments, and low trust between the stakeholders.
   Research limitations/implications - The infancy of the beef trade, the
   paucity of literature on the topic, and restricted accessibility to key
   governmental and official materials imposes limits on the available
   information. Language and cultural barriers might have also impacted the
   interviewees' responses. However, the participation of Brazilian and
   Chinese academics in both the interview analysis and chain mapping
   mitigates these shortcomings.
   Practical implications - The Brazilian public and private sectors need
   to establish a reliable traceability system and information platform.
   This, together with investments in marketing and branding, would
   facilitate differential responses among traders and consumers, and,
   hence, improve supply chain sustainability.
   Originality/value - By adopting an inter-country approach and directly
   sourcing views from specific key figures in the supply chain this study
   offers some unique insights and contributes to the literature on the
   emergence of a multi-polar global food trade.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting Halal meat purchase intention}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{527-541}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants
   of Halal meat consumption within international Muslim students'
   population in China using the theory of planned behaviour as a
   conceptual framework. The role of self-identity (SI) as a Muslim,
   dietary acculturation (DA) in the host culture, moral obligation (MO) to
   purchase Halal meat and trust on the authenticity of Halal meat is
   explored.
   Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional data were collected
   through a questionnaire survey with 436 international Muslim students
   mainly originating from Muslim countries and currently studying in
   China. Data were analysed by stepwise multiple regression analyses to
   test the model and the moderating effects of SI, DA, MO and trust on
   behavioural intention.
   Findings - The results indicate that a positive personal attitude
   towards the consumption of Halal meat, personal conviction and the
   perceived control over consuming Halal meat predict the intention to eat
   Halal meat among Muslims.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the use of a
   snow-ball sampling technique and the focus on only four individual
   characteristics related to religious food consumption, namely, SI, DA,
   MO and trust.
   Practical implications - Practical implications extend to dealing with
   food policymakers and food marketing managers in companies who might
   pursue identity-,acculturation-, MO- and trustworthinessrelated
   strategies in their distribution and communication efforts targeted at
   the growing local as well as international market of Halal food.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first studies investigating
   the determinants of Halal meat consumption among international Muslim
   students in China and a first application of the theory of planned
   behaviour-related religious food consumption context by considering four
   individual characteristics, namely, SI, DA, MO and trust.}},

Title = {{A survey of consumer attitude towards nutrition and health statements on
   food labels in South Australia}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL FOODS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{809-821}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: For many decades, Australia has required a Nutrient
   Information Panel to be included on food packaging, usually on the back
   of products. Recently, two regulated, voluntary systems were introduced
   for use on food packaging in Australia: the Health Star Rating system
   and nutrient content and health claims. Nonetheless, the scope and
   potential for these new initiatives to achieve their purpose is partly
   depdendant on their perception by consumers. This report describes the
   results of a population based survey of South Australian adults about
   how various elements of food labels are used to inform their purchase
   decisions.
   Methods: A survey was conducted using a random stratified sampling
   technique in people aged 15 years and older in the Australian state of
   South Australia. All surveys were administered face-to-face to 3005
   people between September 2015 and December 2015. Data was weighted by
   the inverse of the individual's probability of selection, as well as the
   response rate in metropolitan and country regions and then reweighted to
   benchmarks from the June 2014 Estimated Resident Population calculated
   by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
   Results: The response rate for the survey was 57.3\%. Most respondents
   to the survey rated their own dietary intake as `healthy' (61.5\%) or
   `extremely healthy' (9.1\%). Aside from price, country of origin was
   nominated as the most important information on the food label of a food
   bought for the first time (by 35.0\%), followed by the ingredient list
   (21.6\%) and claims about nutrition (20.9\%). The response to this
   question was markedly different by age group, with almost half (48.3\%)
   of those aged 55 years or over considering that country of origin was
   the most important information to look for. For the youngest age group
   (15-34 yrs), 28.4\% considered the ingredient list was the most
   important information, 26.5\% considered claims about nutrition to be
   most important, and 22.2\% considered country of origin to be the most
   important information on the food label. The Nutrition Information Panel
   was used to guide the purchase decision for a new breakfast cereal by
   more than half of respondents (50.8\%), while a statement on the front
   of the pack about how the food effects health was used to guide the
   purchase decision of only 8.9\%. While only 22.1\% disagreed (16.4\%
   disagreed somewhat, 5.7\% disagreed completely) with the statement that
   `the Nutrient Information Panel on food packaging is a trustworthy
   source of information,' almost double the amount of subjects at 44.0\%
   disagreed (36.1\% disagreed somewhat, 17.9\% disagreed completely) that
   `statements about health on food packaging are a trustworthy source of
   information.'
   Conclusion: For South Australian adults, statements about health
   benefits of food on food packaging are viewed with much greater
   suspicion than the nutrient information panel. Attitudes towards food
   packaging varied more by age group than by sex of the respondent. For an
   unfamiliar food, country of origin is considered the most important
   information on food packaging by more than a third of adults.}},

Title = {{The Determinants of Organic Vegetable Purchasing in Jabodetabek Region,
   Indonesia}},
Journal = {{FOODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Over the last few years, the global market of organic vegetables has
   grown. This is due to increased consumer concern regarding environmental
   and health issues, especially for food products. This study aims to
   examine factors that influence consumer behavior in purchasing organic
   vegetables. In this study, data were obtained from household surveys
   conducted in the Jabodetabek region (Greater Jakarta) from February to
   March 2015. Descriptive analysis, factor analysis, and a binary logit
   model were used to analyze the data. Subsequently, the results show that
   consumers with fewer family members and have a higher income, and are
   price tolerant, are more likely to purchase organic vegetables.
   Meanwhile, female consumers are less likely to buy organic vegetables.
   Another important finding is that positive attitude towards organic
   products, safety and health, environmental concerns, as well as degree
   of trust in organic attributes, are the determinants of organic
   vegetable purchasing among consumers. Therefore, based on the study
   results, the following recommendations are needed for organic vegetable
   development in Indonesia: (a) implementing an appropriate pricing
   strategy; (b) encouraging organic labeling and certification for
   vegetables; and (c) intensively promoting organic food with respect to
   consumers' motives and concerns on health, safety, as well as
   environmental sustainability.}},

Journal = {{TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The global halal industry is currently the fastest growing
   consumer segments in the world, estimated to be worth over one trillion
   dollars. It has become a powerful market force with Muslims and
   non-Muslims alike with future demand for halal food likely to remain
   strong. With halal products becoming mainstream consumer goods,
   incorrect certification of the halal brand on food products has become a
   worryingly regular occurrence. In order to rapidly verify the halal
   authentication of food products, sensitive, easy-to-use and reliable
   scientific method is especially required for halal food screening.
   Scope and approach: In this review, we will explain what is considered
   as halal food before describing existing methodologies and their
   limitations in detecting and identifying non-halal components in food
   products. We will also present important technological innovations with
   significant potential as routine detection tools for halal analysis.
   Key findings and conclusions: The most commonly used molecular
   biomarkers during food analyses are proteins and DNA. Although DNA is
   generally considered to be most appropriate for animal species
   detection, it still presents numerous drawbacks. Nonetheless, with rapid
   development of modern technology in biological analysis, a number of
   approaches incorporating latest biotechnological innovations with
   regards to halal authentication have emerged such as point-of-care
   diagnostics and integration of assays with smartphones. It is clear that
   the evolution of the halal industry presents itself as a lucrative
   market to be tapped into and needs to be supported by reliable and
   efficient screening methods to ensure that food production is aligned
   with the halal principles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Meat consumption-associated cancer risks relating to the preservative
   nitrate are receiving considerable attention. Consequently, innovative
   meat products are being developed with no or reduced nitrate levels. For
   example, phytochemicals are currently under investigation for their
   potential to replace nitrate in meat. Consumers are becoming more aware
   of health aspects of consumed foods, a trend which is accompanied by an
   increase in health claims on food products. However, consumer acceptance
   of a health claim is dependent on consumer credibility of the claim. In
   order to produce a health claim, perceived credible by consumers, it
   should be known which factors influence consumer credibility. This pilot
   study investigated the extent to which consumers perceive health claims
   on innovative meat products credible and which factors influence this
   credibility. By means of a questionnaire distributed amongst 1010 Dutch
   participants representative of the Dutch population, factors like health
   claim promoters, media platforms, and the phrasing of the proposed
   health claim were investigated. Main results are that the majority of
   consumers indicates meat products with phytochemicals as acceptable.
   Promotion by a national health foundation is perceived as credible, and
   health magazines are perceived as a credible media platform. This study
   found that neither weekly meat consumption, sex, nor age have effect on
   the consumer credibility of certain health claims, but that educational
   level does. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread growth of information and telecommunication technologies
   (ICTs) in rural areas of developing countries offers new opportunities
   to provide more timely and low-cost information services to farmers, as
   well as assist in coordinating agricultural agents. Over the past
   decade, the number of public and private sector initiatives in this
   space has increased substantially, with over 140 deployments worldwide
   in 2015. While there is substantial potential for such services to
   address farmers' and traders' information and credit market constraints,
   economic research suggests that the impacts of such services on
   agricultural adoption, behavior and welfare is mixed. While this can, in
   part, be explained by the degree of the information asymmetry and the
   presence of other market failures in different contexts, research from
   other disciplines provides additional insights into these findings. In
   particular, work in the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI)
   focuses heavily on users' interaction and experience with a given
   technology, thus explaining why users may not fully engage with
   ICT-based agricultural interfaces. Furthermore, sociological and
   anthropological approaches study the provision of information and trust
   and how these may be altered by ICT platforms. Drawing upon these
   disciplines, we suggest that future ICT for agriculture initiatives
   should first seek to better understand the information and complementary
   market failures in a given context, in order to better understand
   whether information is a binding constraint. Second, even if information
   is missing, the information services provided should be of high quality
   and from a trusted source, which can be a challenge with some ICT
   platforms. Finally, such services should be delivered via platforms that
   build upon local ICT access and usage, paying particular attention to
   the gender digital divide.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture and especially maize cultivation represent one of the most
   important socioeconomic activities for food security in Mexico.
   Throughout time, empirical knowledge has been transmitted from
   generation to generation. In the study, surveys were applied to farmers
   in the Central-Eastern region of the state of Puebla, with experience in
   sowing maize, during 2014 and 2015. The objective of the research was to
   explain the relationship between climate-temperature and precipitation-,
   at pentad scale, with the proverbs and yields of the years 1980, 1987,
   2011 and 2013. Results showed that at least half of the farmers trust in
   the sayings and, as consequence, in years with good yields of the maize
   crop, most of them were validated, while for those considered as
   ``regular{''} and ``bad{''}, most did not come true. These two
   situations can be explained in terms of an optimistic vision of the
   farmer. It is concluded that peasant empirical knowledge about
   time/weather prediction is accepted by an important number of farmers
   and continues to influence agricultural activities.}},

   systems}},
Journal = {{TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Background: Food chains have changed dramatically due to technical and
   demographic changes over the last decades. Although efforts are made to
   ensure high quality and integrity, food-borne outbreaks and food
   scandals still happen to an undesired extent.
   Scope and approach: This commentary paper aims to give insight in the
   current approach in the European food control and audit system, the
   underestimation of complexity and the role of trust in food control and
   auditing. Furthermore, the need for complex systems thinking in
   risk-based auditing is discussed and a framework to structure complex
   system risk-based auditing is proposed.
   Key findings and conclusions: The current food control system seems to
   cause a reactive vicious cycle, which leads to more and stricter
   regulations and standards on every level. A new paradigm in risk-based
   auditing is needed that acknowledges the behaviour of complex systems to
   ensure trust along the food chain. The proposed framework for complex
   system risk-based auditing may enable a systematic analysis of audit
   triggers, audit goals and context characteristics suggesting multiple
   methods for risk analysis, as basis for the questions on when, how,
   what, and whom to audit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   to be able to make a conscious decision about dish selection in all four
   countries. Latent class analysis shows that consumers align to one of
   five cluster groups, i.e., Value Driven, Conventionalists, Socially

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{57-65}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The majority of studies examining the effect of nutrition information on
   food packets (such as the nutrition information panel (NIP),
   front-of-pack labels (FoPLs) and health claims) have examined each in
   isolation, even though they often occur together. This study
   investigated the relationship between FoPLs and health claims since (i)
   they both appear on the front of packs and typically receive more
   attention from consumers than the NIP, (ii) they can convey
   contradictory messages (i.e., health claims provide information on
   nutrients that are beneficial to health while FoPLs provide information
   on nutrients associated with increased health risks) and (iii) there is
   currently scant research on how consumers trade off between these two
   sources of information. Ten focus groups (n = 85) explored adults' and
   children's reactions when presented with both a FoPL (the Daily Intake
   Guide, Multiple Traffic Lights, or the Health Star Rating) and a health
   claim (nutrient content, general-level-, or high-level). A particular
   focus was participants' processing of discrepant information.
   Participants reported that health claims were more likely to be
   considered during product evaluations if they were perceived to be
   trustworthy, relevant and informative. Trust and ease of interpretation
   were most important for FoPLs, which were more likely than health claims
   to meet criteria and be considered during product evaluation (especially
   the Health Star Rating and Multiple Traffic Lights). Results indicate
   that consumers generally find FoPLs more useful than health claims. (C)

Abstract = {{This study examined whether the causal relationships of protection
   motivation theory (PMT) can be applied to explain and predict the
   public's behavioural intentions for safe food choice through protection
   motivation of health and well-being promotion in Taiwan. In addition,
   the public's perceived food risk management quality and perceived
   product safety liability of food providers involved in food safety
   scandals were considered in the PMT model. The results of structural
   equation modelling indicated that, compared with the original PMT model,
   the extended PMT model demonstrates higher explanatory and predictive
   power of a person's protection motivation to mitigate food safety
   problems, but lower explanatory and predictive power of a person's
   behavioural intentions to make safe food choices. The empirical results
   drawn from the extended PMT model revealed that in addition to perceived
   vulnerability regarding the threat of food safety scandals and perceived
   self-efficacy, a person's perceived product safety liability of food
   providers involved in food safety scandals is a significant predictor of

Abstract = {{This study assessed changes in farmers' attitudes to agricultural
   cooperatives by developing a behavioral framework based in psychological
   and psychometric theory for measuring attitude change. The assessment
   focused on a unique dataset that allowed attitude coverage and strength
   of evaluation derived from data collected in 1993 and in 2013 to be
   evaluated. Explorative factor analytical methods revealed the attitude
   construct to be two-dimensional in both datasets, covering the domains
   named Commitment and Trust in both cases. Thus, the coverage of the
   attitude construct seemed unchanged. However, the strength of evaluation
   of both attitude dimensions was significantly increased. These findings
   have clear policy implications for agricultural cooperatives, since
   understanding the nature of changes in attitudes to these organizations
   is important for their successful development. {[}EconLit citations:

Abstract = {{Pork safety is an important public health concern in Vietnam and is a
   shared responsibility among many actors along the pork value chain. We
   examined the knowledge, perceptions, and practices regarding food
   safety, disease, and health risk among selected pork value chain actors
   (slaughterhouse owners and workers, people living around
   slaughterhouses, pork sellers, consumers, and veterinary and public
   health staff) in three districts in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam. We
   randomly selected 52 pork value chain actors to be surveyed through
   questionnaires, observation checklists, key informant interviews, and
   focus group discussions. Most slaughterhouse workers acquired knowledge
   and experience of food safety through ``learning by doing{''} rather
   than from training by a veterinary or public health professional. Both
   slaughterhouse worker and pork seller groups had some accurate
   perceptions about pig diseases and foodbome diseases; however,
   misperceptions of risk and, especially, of zoonoses were present.
   Furthermore, while workers and sellers often use cloths to dry the meat
   and clean equipment, they did not think this was a risk for meat
   contamination. Moreover, when sellers wear protective equipment, such as
   gloves, masks, or hats, consumers perceive that the sellers may have
   health issues they are trying to conceal and so consumers avoid buying
   from them. The perceived freshness of pork, along with trust in the
   seller and in the pork production process, were strong indicators of
   consumer preference. And yet, pork value chain actors tend to trust
   their own individual food safety practices more, rather than the
   practices of other actors along the chain. Veterinary and public health
   staff emphasized the gap between regulations and food safety practices.
   Education and training on food safety risks and proper handling are
   priorities, along with integrated and intensive efforts to improve food
   safety among pork value chain actors.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the recent cases of meat adulteration and fraud, efficient
   and accurate analytical methods are needed for the specific
   identification of meat species as a key importance to maintain
   consumers' trust and to comply with various local labelling
   legislations. As a reference approach, the application of PCR to meat
   speciation is always limited to few species, whereas there is a strong
   need to broaden the number of identified meat species. PCR was here
   associated with a commercial DNA macro-array spotted with meat-specific
   capture probes, allowing the simultaneous identification of 32 meat
   species on 8 samples per chip support. Tested on pure meat samples,
   spiked samples, proficiency test samples, and processed samples, the
   method showed high specificity on the targeted species and allowed a
   sensitivity down to 1\% (w/w). Easy-to-use, fast and cost-efficient,
   this multi-screening approach is fit-for-purpose as a tool to detect
   meat substitution or adulteration for meat testing laboratories. (C)

Abstract = {{Personalised diets based on people's existing food choices, and/or
   phenotypic, and/or genetic information hold potential to improve public
   dietary-related health. The aim of this analysis, therefore, has been to
   examine the degree to which factors which determine uptake of
   personalised nutrition vary between EU countries to better target
   policies to encourage uptake, and optimise the health benefits of
   personalised nutrition technology. A questionnaire developed from
   previous qualitative research was used to survey nationally
   representative samples from 9 EU countries (N = 9381). Perceived
   barriers to the uptake of personalised nutrition comprised three factors
   (data protection; the eating context; and, societal acceptance). Trust
   in sources of information comprised four factors (commerce and media;
   practitioners; government; family and, friends). Benefits comprised a
   single factor. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to compare
   differences in responses between the United Kingdom; Ireland; Portugal;
   Poland; Norway; the Netherlands; Germany; and, Spain. The results
   indicated that respondents in Greece, Poland, Ireland, Portugal and
   Spain, rated the benefits of personalised nutrition highest, suggesting
   a particular readiness in these countries to adopt personalised
   nutrition interventions. Greek participants were more likely to perceive
   the social context of eating as a barrier to adoption of personalised
   nutrition, implying a need for support in negotiating social situations
   while on a prescribed diet. Those in Spain, Germany, Portugal and Poland
   scored highest on perceived barriers related to data protection.
   Government was more trusted than commerce to deliver and provide
   information on personalised nutrition overall. This was particularly the
   case in Ireland, Portugal and Greece, indicating an imperative to build
   trust, particularly in the ability of commercial service providers to
   deliver personalised dietary regimes effectively in these countries.
   These findings, obtained from a nationally representative sample of EU
   citizens, imply that a parallel, integrated, public-private delivery
   system would capture the needs of most potential consumers. (C) 2016

   From these points of view it becomes obvious that there is a high demand

   be used easily by consumers, regulators and food administrators to check
   with one measurement origin and quality of a product. In this context
   miniaturized infrared spectroscopic devices give great promise to fulfil

Title = {{The process of making trust related judgements through interaction with
   food labelling}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is both empirical and theoretical research supporting the idea
   that consumers' interaction with food labelling impacts on their trust
   in the food system and its actors. This paper explores the process by
   which consumers' interpretation of, and interaction with, labelling
   results in the formation of trust related judgements. In-depth,
   semi-structured interviews with 24 Australian consumers were conducted.
   Theoretical sampling was used to gather a wide range of consumer
   perspectives. Real food packages were used as prompts for discussion in
   interviews, with one interview section requiring participants to examine
   particular products while thinking aloud. Process and thematic coding
   were used in transcript analysis. Labelling was seen by participants as
   a direct and active communication with `labellers'. The messages
   communicated by individual label elements were interpreted more broadly
   than their regulatory definitions and were integrated during the process
   of making sense of labelling. This enabled participants to form trust
   related judgements through interaction with labelling. Finally, product
   and consumer characteristics varied participants' judgements about the
   same or similar label elements and products. Divergence in consumer and
   regulatory interpretations of labelling creates a situation where
   labelling may be both fully compliant with all relevant legislation and
   regulation, and still be perceived as misleading by consumers. This
   suggests that the rational frameworks that policy seeks to overlay on
   consumers when considering food labelling regulation may be hindering
   consumer belief in the trustworthiness of labellers. Policy must
   recognise the different, yet equally legitimate, ways of interpreting
   labelling if it is to foster, and not undermine, consumer trust in the
   food system generally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyzes the demand for a simple rainfall-based weather
   insurance product among farmers in rural India. We explore the
   predictions of a standard expected utility theory framework on the
   nature of demand in terms of price, the basis of the hedge, and risk
   aversion using data from a randomized control trial. We find that demand
   behaves as predicted: it falls with price and basis risk and is
   hump-shaped in risk aversion, with price sensitivity decreasing at
   higher levels of basis risk. We estimate a negative price elasticity of
   0.58 and find that doubling the distance to a reference weather station
   decreases demand by 18\%. These results indicate that improving pricing
   and quality of insurance products can directly increase demand. In
   addition, we examine the impact of insurance training relative to other
   mechanisms designed to increase understanding. The evidence suggests
   that increased incentives to learn or learning by using are more
   effective at increasing both understanding and demand. Finally, we
   contribute to the scarce evidence on the demand for insurance over time.
   In terms of our main interventions, we find that the effect of premium
   subsidies persists over time, while the impact of investments in new
   weather stations diminishes and the effect of increased training in the
   first season seems to disappear during the second season. Importantly,
   while having previously purchased insurance does not encourage future
   uptake, receiving a payout does. This could reflect issues of trust in
   the product or the insurance company, and constitutes an important topic
   for future research.}},

Title = {{Good governance? Perceptions of accountability, transparency and
   effectiveness in Irish food risk governance}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In an attempt to govern increasingly globalised, industrialised and
   risky food chains, food safety authorities (FSAs) have been established
   worldwide as part of a catalogue of food risk governance reforms
   undertaken in response to continuing food crises. Despite these
   significant shifts in governing arrangements however, little work has
   been conducted regarding how consumers respond to, resist and/or engage
   with these new governance systems in everyday, non-crisis contexts. As
   such, this paper explores the everyday governance of food risk from the
   perspective of those whose voices typically go unheard in food
   policymaking processes - consumers. Drawing on empirical results from
   focus groups conducted with publics across the Republic of Ireland,
   consumer perceptions, priorities and lived experiences relating to food
   risk governance, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) in
   particular, are explored. This analysis is couched within a normative
   frame of multi-scalar governance and what makes it `good' or effective.
   Accordingly, the paper advances food risk policy debates through a. lens
   of normative good food risk governance, including analysis of the
   perceived accountability, transparency and effectiveness of Irish food
   risk governing structures from a consumer perspective. Identifying
   limitations in current governing regimes, the paper concludes by
   critically reflecting on the opportunities and challenges for adopting
   more adaptive forms of governance in the multi-scalar and evolving
   policy context that typifies food risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Time preferences have been recognized by numerous studies as an
   important driver of a number of healthy and environmentally-friendly
   behaviors. In this study, we first examined if healthy and
   environmentally-friendly food labels (e.g., USDA organic, carbon trust,
   health claim, and calories) are relevant in driving food choices.
   Second, using the Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC) scale we
   analyzed if individuals with different time preferences have different
   choice behavior and valuations in relation to these labels. Results
   indicate that consumers value both healthy and environmentally friendly
   attributes displayed on labels. Results also suggest that time
   preferences can significantly influence consumers' valuation for the
   USDA organic label, the presence of health claims and the calorie amount
   attribute. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Risk analysis and risk governance face a decline in social trust at both
   the scientific and policy levels. The involvement of society in the
   process has been proposed as an approach to increasing trust and
   engagement by making better use of available data and knowledge. In this
   session, EFSA explored the challenges in building trust and engagement
   and the latest thinking and methodologies for increasing openness that
   can help the organisation to move beyond traditional dialogue and
   towards a more sustainable stakeholder and society interaction. The
   discussion centred on the needs of EFSA and of target audiences
   throughout the process, from risk assessment initiation through societal
   decision-making and communication. The main focus of the session was on
   methodologies and approaches that would enable EFSA to increase its
   scientific rigour and build trust from additional inputs gained by
   opening up its risk assessments at the level of data gathering, data
   analysis, expertise and innovation. This will require an approach that
   moves beyond traditional risk assessment practices that rely on a long
   chain of static information and knowledge such as scientific articles,
   reviews, expert groups and committees. (C) 2016 European Food Safety

Abstract = {{In this study, the experimental auction method is used in a

   difference in bids for the functional and control products defines the
   implicit WTP variable. WTP exhibits a statistically significant total
   difference between real and hypothetical bids increasing at the upper
   and lower levels of bids. Implicit WTP shows differences that are of
   opposite signs and that balance on average. Focusing on the factors
   driving the bias, the empirical analysis indicates two primary groups of

Abstract = {{Consumers' food purchase behavior is influenced by label information
   displayed on the product. However, consumers vary in their label
   knowledge, affecting their individual product quality perception and
   purchase intent. An eye-tracking is an objective methodology that has
   been used to analyze consumers' purchase behavior in terms of their
   visual attention to labels. The aim of this study was to determine the
   effect of label education on consumers' purchase behavior, measured with
   respect to their visual attention to label claims on chicken products.
   Twenty-nine participants with prior food label education were chosen to
   represent the High Label Understanding (HLU) group. Additionally, 29 new
   participants without any kind of prior label education were selected as
   a Control (CNTL) group. Each participant viewed packaging images of
   chicken meat products using the eye-tracker and answered additional
   subjective questions relating to their potential purchase behavior
   (purchase intent, trust in product, and overall liking). Participants in
   the CNTL group examined the appearance of the meat product more often
   and longer than did those in the HLU group. In contrast, participants in
   the HLU group looked at the label claims associated with sustainability
   and process more often and longer than did those in the CNTL group.
   Furthermore, participants in the HLU group liked and trusted the chicken
   products significantly more than did those in the CNTL group. In
   conclusion, our findings provide empirical evidence that enhanced
   label-knowledge increases consumers' visual attention to labels with a
   possibility of translation into positive purchase behavior. Published by

Abstract = {{A study concerning time-temperature information sharing behavior in the
   one-step forward chilled and frozen food supply chains was conducted. We
   mailed 1774 questionnaires to food manufacturing companies in Taiwan
   with a response rate of 7.0\%. We showed that obtaining raw materials
   time-temperature information from suppliers was more difficult than
   obtaining processed food product information from food manufacturers.
   The determinant factors considered were also different. For sharing time
   temperature information on raw materials during distribution from
   suppliers to food manufacturers, the relative power of food
   manufacturers, business strategy, and raw material quality uncertainty
   were important. However, for sharing information on processed product
   during distribution from food manufacturers to buyers, only business
   strategy and processed product quality uncertainty were important. This
   implies that requesting information from suppliers requires more effort.
   In addition, when zooming in, we found that the time-temperature sharing
   strategies of companies differ in the subsectors. For instance, the
   chilled food sector has higher willingness to share time-temperature
   information than the frozen food sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study investigates transactions in the local coffee markets in
   Ethiopia. While the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, which was established
   in 2008, introduced regulatory, institutional, and organizational
   innovations in the coffee market, informal norms and conventions remain
   the primary institutions governing transactions in the local markets.
   Based on a choice experiment, we found that for coffee farmers the
   characteristics of the traders are more important than the price offered
   when anchoring their transactions into personal relationships. This can
   be explained as the institutional response of farsighted calculative
   farmers to poorly organized coffee markets and to lacking credit and
   insurance markets. Contrary to the concept of embeddedness, which claims
   that economic transactions are embedded into social relationships,
   social relationships are observed to be embedded into economic
   relationships. One of the perverse effects of these personal
   relationship-based transactions is that farmers are insufficiently
   incentivized to maintain and improve coffee quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To provide greater transparency and comprehensive information to
   consumers regarding their purchase choices, the European Parliament and
   the Council have mandated via Regulation 1169/2011 that foods containing
   engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) be labeled. This review covers the main
   concerns related to the use of ENMs in foods and the potential impacts
   that this type of food labeling might have on diverse stakeholder
   groups, including those outside the European Union (EU), e.g., in the
   United States. We also provide recommendations to stakeholders for
   overcoming existing challenges related to labeling foods containing
   ENMs. The revised EU food labeling requirements will likely result in a
   number of positive developments and a number of challenges for
   stakeholders in both EU and non-EU countries. Although labeling of foods
   containing ENMs will likely improve transparency, provide more
   information to facilitate consumer decisions, and build trust among food
   safety authorities and consumers, critical obstacles to the successful
   implementation of these labeling requirements remain, including the need
   for (i) harmonized information requirements or regulations between
   countries in different regions of the world, (ii) clarification of the
   regulatory definitions of the ENMs to be used for food labeling, (iii)
   robust techniques to detect, measure, and characterize diverse ENMs in
   food matrices, and (iv) clarification of the list of ENMs that may be
   exempt from labeling requirements, such as several food additives used
   for decades. We recommend that food industries and food safety
   authorities be more proactive in communicating with the public and
   consumer groups regarding the potential benefits and risks of using ENMs
   in foods. Efforts should be made to improve harmonization of information
   requirements between countries to avoid potential international trade
   bathers.}},

Title = {{Awareness of ag-gag laws erodes trust in farmers and increases support
   for animal welfare regulations}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Hidden-camera investigations are becoming an increasingly popular means
   of raising public awareness about farm animal welfare. However,
   livestock industries claim they are deceptive. One strategy to curtail
   these investigations has been the introduction of so-called ag-gag
   legislation, which aims to restrict the flow of information coming out
   of farm facilities. Psychological research suggests that this approach
   may be counter-productive as reducing information flow often reduces
   feelings of trust. We sought to extend these findings by applying them
   to a real-world, timely example and to determine whether the perceived
   intention to obstruct access to information erodes feelings of trust.
   Accordingly, this study tested whether simply being made aware of ag-gag
   laws might have a negative impact on trust in farmers. Participants (n =
   716) were randomly assigned to either receive information about ag-gag
   laws or to a Control condition. We found that most people were unaware
   of ag-gag laws and that learning about them lead to a decrease in trust
   in farmers and an increase in support for animal welfare regulations.
   Interestingly, we also found evidence that awareness of ag-gag laws
   negatively impacted perceptions of the current status of farm animal
   welfare as well as the perception that farmers do a good job of
   protecting the environment. Through this topical example, this study
   demonstrates that even the intention to restrict access to information
   can undermine trust. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have measured the perceptions of consumers on different
   aspects of food safety but only a limited number of studies focused on
   consumer's perception of vegetable safety risks in developing countries.
   This study aimed to investigate consumers' behaviors and concerns on
   vegetable purchase and safety in Beijing urban areas. It identified the
   factors influencing consumers' behaviors on vegetable purchase, safety
   and information channel with different demographic groups of consumers.
   A total 590 of valid questionnaires were collected in this study in
   January, 2015. The participants of 352 female and 238 male were
   consumers shopping at the supermarkets in Beijing urban areas. Results
   indicated that consumers intended to choose their trusted purchasing
   places to purchase vegetables, and their perceptions of ``freshness{''}
   (m = 4.61, sd. = 0.78) and ``pesticide residues{''} (m = 4.57, sd. =
   0.95) were the top concerns. Female and senior consumers were more
   concerned about vegetable safety. Consumers who purchase vegetables
   frequently were more likely to pay attention to food safety and quality
   than the ones who have never brought vegetables. Consumers used
   different information channels to get vegetable knowledge. Most
   consumers used traditional information channels such as TV and
   broadcasting, while young and well-educated consumers relied more on
   internet. The findings suggested that some safety control measures need
   to be taken through the vegetable supply chain to reduce the hazards and
   ensure vegetable safety, which would help to establish or rebuild
   consumers' trusts on vegetable safety. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{When new consumer products are developed and later launched, 50 to 75
   percent of them are removed from the market far short of meeting their
   projected financial targets. In short: they fail. We conclude that this
   failure is due to institutionalized insufficiencies in the use of the
   sciences that are best geared to understand and predict consumer
   behaviour, viz. the behavioural sciences. These are not necessarily the
   same as the marketing science that is performed by marketing
   departments. A scientific approach to understanding consumer behaviour
   appears to be lacking in many corporate research surroundings. This
   often is in great contrast with their high levels of technological
   science, paralleled by their respective research budgets. In this paper
   we present five problem areas that may contribute to this mismatch,
   contributing to needlessly high numbers of product failures. We have
   termed these factors: (1) `pillars' (too many different functions
   addressing different aspects of the consumers and of product
   development), (2) `higher management focus' (not geared towards
   understanding consumer behaviour), (3) `popular science books'
   (out-dated research directives resulting from a hierarchical management
   model), (4) `quality and Quality' (a definition of `quality' that leads
   to invalid quality parameters), and (5) `psychophobia' (the latent fear
   of trusting behavioural science results), respectively. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The present study explores the concept of mistrust in country of origin
   information and the use of technology by consumers to corroborate
   information on food labels. Despite the plethora of food studies on
   trust conveyed by different sources, there appears to be a lack of
   studies exploring consumers' willingness to substantiate information on
   food labels, more specifically country of origin, and how it is
   influenced by mistrust. A self-administered survey was conducted in the
   city of Innsbruck, Austria, to evaluate the relationship between
   mistrust and the willingness to use technology and verify food label
   information in food stores. This present study suggests that mistrust
   towards industry and/or regulators in general augments consumers'
   willingness to self-authenticate. Findings also suggest that highly
   educated consumers are more likely to distrust the information on food
   labels, and are more willing to use a device to validate food label
   content. Expected results suggest that consumers who read labels on a
   regular basis expressed a higher willingness to self-authenticate, and
   that women are more likely to read labels than men. Limitations of the
   study are presented; theoretical significance and practical implications

Abstract = {{Despite having poor hygiene and sanitation, and with rising concerns
   about food safety from production to handling, traditional food markets
   remain a significant point of purchase in the developing world. However,
   it remains unclear how consumers arrive at their valuation of food
   quality attributes. This study examined the determinants of actual
   behavior to upgrade to safety-and hygiene-enhanced fresh produce. More
   specifically, the integrative model of behavioral prediction was adapted
   with internal factors to identify determinants of real payments elicited
   with the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism. A field experiment (n = 147)
   was conducted with consumers of kale (Brassica oleracea) at a
   traditional pen-urban market in Nairobi, Kenya. Partial least squares
   path modeling and censored quantile regression analysis were used to
   detect different structural relationships between the set of the
   determinants and real payments along the range of auction prices. The
   results show that among consumers with low valuations, payments were
   reduced by salience, but increased by social anxiety and trust. In
   addition, trust helped to increase payments around the median bids.
   Among consumers with higher valuations, payments were increased by
   salience. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating a
   non-linear setting when analyzing the influence of salience and social
   evaluation on auction bids. These asymmetrical structural relationships
   have important implications for the design and validity of monetary
   valuations and field auction experiments involving measurement of real
   payments for food product attributes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{140-150}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The organic label has been studied extensively in the literature;
   however, few studies take into consideration the context in which the
   organic purchase takes place. In this study, we examine the product type
   (virtue vs. vice) as well as the purchase context (retailer: Target vs.
   Walmart). Using an online experiment with U.S. consumers (N= 605), we
   determine how the organic label interacts with each of these contexts
   and how these interactions impact downstream evaluations such as
   expected taste, nutrition, safety, likelihood of purchase, and attitude
   and trust toward the product's brand. Results of the study reveal both
   the organic label and retail context impact product evaluations. First,
   results showed organic products were perceived more favorably on a
   number of measures (including nutrition, safety, brand attitude, and
   brand trust) than their non-organic counterparts, providing evidence of
   an organic ``halo{''} effect. Interestingly, though, the organic
   ``halo{''} did not extend to two measures: expected taste and likelihood
   of purchase. Secondly, organic labeling benefits virtue and vice
   products in distinct aspects - the organic virtue product had better
   expected taste while the organic vice product had higher expected
   nutrition. Finally, we find that retailers are a crucial factor that
   moderates the evaluation of organic products. Our results suggest
   retailers like Target may be better outlets for promoting organic vice
   products whereas retailers like Walmart may only be good outlets for
   promoting organic virtue products. This study has important implications
   for the National Organic Program, the Organic Trade Association,
   producers, and food brand managers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Thirty-three counterparts who experienced no educational intervention
   regarding label claims participated as a ``Control (CNTL){''} group;
   both groups were matched in terms of demographic profiles and purchase
   frequency of chicken-meat products. Participants in both groups
   evaluated the same four chicken-meat samples labeled with four different
   label-claims, i.e., ``USDA Organic{''}, ``No Hormones Added{''}, ``USDA
   Process Verified{''}, and a no-label condition. For the HLU group,
   perceptions of chicken meat with respect to overall quality, trust in
   quality, freshness, overall liking, and juiciness differed significantly
   among the four label-claim conditions. However, no significant
   differences in this regard were observed in the CNTL group. The label
   claims-induced intensities of tenderness, juiciness, and chicken flavor
   of chicken-meat samples did not differ between the two groups. In
   conclusion, the findings demonstrated that the effects of
   sustainability-related label claims on quality perception and
   acceptability of chicken meat became significantly more pronounced when
   consumers understood and trusted the label claims. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: This paper studies which of the attitudinal, cognitive and
   socio-economic factors determine the willingness to purchase genetically
   modified (GM) food, enabling the forecasting of consumers' behaviour in
   Andalusia, southern Spain. This classification has been made by a
   standard multilayer perceptron neural network trained with extreme
   learning machine. Later, an ordered logistic regression was applied to
   determine whether the neural network can outperform this traditional
   econometric approach.
   RESULTS: The results show that the highest relative contributions lie in
   the variables related to perceived risks of GM food, while the perceived
   benefits have a lower influence. In addition, an innovative attitude
   towards food presents a strong link, as does the perception of food
   safety. The variables with the least relative contribution are
   subjective knowledge about GM food and the consumers' age. The neural
   network approach outperforms the correct classification percentage from
   the ordered logistic regression.
   CONCLUSION: The perceived risks must be considered as a critical factor.
   A strategy to improve the GM food acceptance is to develop a transparent
   and balanced information framework that makes the potential risk
   understandable by society, and make them aware of the risk assessments
   for GM food in the EU. For its success, it is essential to improve the
   trust in EU institutions and scientific regulatory authorities. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In a typical contract farming arrangement, a firm contracts a farmer to
   deliver a certain quantity-quality combination of a product at a certain
   point in time for payment at a specified price based on quality
   attributes. These arrangements tend to be subject to lack of `trust' on
   both sides, since they typically are subject to asymmetric information
   because quality attributes are unobservable and costly to assess. We
   conducted variants of framed trust games using contract dairy farmers in
   Vietnam as first movers to assess (1) baseline trust between these
   farmers and the firm that contracts them and (2) the impact of potential
   collusion between the firm and a third party on trust. While farmers are
   more likely to trust in the presence of the third party, potential
   collusion does not significantly reduce their propensity to trust. We
   discuss the external validity of our findings and some implications for
   policy.}},

Abstract = {{Governance of water use for irrigation is a challenging topic, due to
   alteration in climatic patterns and the resulting resource scarcity in
   arid and semi-arid regions. Success stories can turn quickly into
   failures when significant disturbances occur. This contribution focuses
   on the institutional analysis to highlight factors which enable or
   constrain the role that Lebanese Water Users' Associations can play to
   tackle current and expected water shortage conditions. Furthermore, by
   integrating Ostrom's design principles and a dynamic game approach, the
   study examines the robustness of participative institutions and their
   operational rules when dealing with climate change generating
   uncertainty about availability of water resources at local level. Water
   governance can find a pivotal actor in local institutions (e.g. users'
   associations) not only if their organization is based on social
   cohesion, reciprocity, trust, information sharing and accountability
   concepts, but also and preliminarily, if higher-level external
   conditions like public recognition and control, inclusion in collective

Abstract = {{Garlic represents a source of various biologically active
   phytomolecules. The content of phenolic compounds in garlic varies
   greatly with genetic, agronomic, and environmental factors, and the
   cultivar is the primary factor which determines this variation. The aim
   of this study was to analyse by Fourier transform near infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-NIR) different garlic cultivars, organically grown or
   commercial ones, coming from four different geographical areas. Garlic
   samples were collected from four different locations, and then analyse
   in the spectral range of the NIR radiation, which extends from 800 to
   2500 nm, using three different modules (integrating sphere, transmission
   and fibre optic modules) that provide tools for analysing most liquid
   and solid samples. For all the measurements, no sample preparation was
   performed, since this analytical technique is non-invasive and
   non-destructive, and each sample was subject to repeated measurements.
   All the FT-NIR garlic spectra were undergone to a post processing
   analysis and compared between them. The comparison enhanced a clear
   distinction between biological and commercial garlic spectra. In
   particular, the last ones were characterised by a greater number of
   absorption peaks. This different trend in the FT-NIR spectra could be
   related to the possible contamination by toxic waste of the cultivation
   soil. Consumers are gradually looking for quality seals and trust marks
   on food products, and expected manufacturers and retailers to provide
   products of high quality. In this context, the FT-NIR represents a valid
   instrument for food classification and an important task for quality
   control and identification of foodstuff product adulteration.}},

Abstract = {{Could the future French eco-label for fresh seafood products find its
   place in the French market? This study employs a contingent valuation
   method to estimate French consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for
   eco-labeled fresh seafood products. We exploit original data from a
   survey carried out in 2010, where 626 participants responded to a
   double-bounded dichotomous choice model, through an ascending or
   descending bid system. Controlling for shift and anchoring effects in
   random effect probit models, we significantly improve estimation of WTP
   and its determinants for the three species studied (monkfish, lobster,
   sole), in particular when using heterogeneous anchoring. We show that
   WTP is positively correlated to respondents' income, and also to their
   environmental concern, to living alone, to living far from the coast,
   and to trusting NGOs or public institutions more than producer
   organizations to implement an eco-label. We also show that the mean
   price premiums do not differ between species. Finally, on average, the
   maximum premium consumers accepted to pay is approximately 10\% of the
   product price.}},

Abstract = {{Regulators and risk managers in general need to decide whether an
   allergenic food or ingredient is of such public health importance that
   it needs to be actively managed. There is therefore a need to scale the
   relative allergenicity of foods and ingredients according to the hazards
   they pose. Objective criteria increase transparency and trust in this
   decision-making process and its conclusions. This paper proposes a
   framework that allows categorisation and prioritisation of allergenic
   foods according to their public health importance. The challenge is to
   find a basis on which the allergenicity of foods can best be described
   and a method to combine the relevant measures of allergenicity into a
   scoring system that prioritises allergenic foods on the basis of their
   public health relevance. The framework is designed in accordance with
   the generic risk analysis principles used in food safety and can be used
   by regulators to decide whether or not a specific allergenic food or
   ingredient is of sufficient public health importance that it warrants
   regulation (i.e. mandatory labelling) when used in the production of
   food products. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Abstract = {{Because food fraud can harm human health and erode consumer trust, it is
   imperative that it is detected at an early stage. Therefore the aim of
   this study was to predict the expected food fraud type for imported
   products for which the product category and country of origin are known
   in order to target enforcement activities. For this purpose we used a
   Bayesian Network (BN) model that was developed based on
   adulteration/fraud notifications as reported in the Rapid Alert System
   for Food and Feed (RASFF) in the period 2000-2013. In this period 749
   food fraud notifications were reported and were categorised in 6
   different fraud types (i) improper, fraudulent, missing or absent health
   certificates, (ii) illegal importation, (iii) tampering, (iv) improper,
   expired, fraudulent or missing common entry documents or import
   declarations, (v) expiration date, (vi) mislabelling. The data were then
   used to develop a BN model. The constructed BN model was validated using
   88 food fraud notifications reported in RASFF in 2014. The proposed
   model predicted 80\% of food fraud types correctly when food fraud type,
   country and food category had been reported previously in RASFF. The
   model predicted 52\% of all 88 food fraud types correctly when the
   country of origin or the product-country combination had not been
   recorded before in the RASFF database. The presented model can aid the
   risk manager/controller in border inspection posts in deciding which
   fraud type to check when importing products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The effect of varying educational intervention on consumers'

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This study focused on comparing the efficiency of educational
   intervention on improving consumers' understanding and attitude toward
   sustainability and process-related label claims. Participants were
   randomly distributed into 1 of 3 educational-intervention groups: (1)
   active learning (discussing label claims with other participants), (2)
   passive learning (reading a flyer about label claims), and (3) passive
   learning with an authoritative effect (attending a professor's lecture
   on label claims). Participants were asked to fill out a survey regarding
   their understanding and attitude toward 10 sustainability and
   process-related labels commonly displayed on chicken meat products at 3
   different times: before, immediately after, and 2 weeks after
   educational intervention. Participants' subjective understanding
   (self-rated awareness) and objective understanding (recall of actual
   knowledge) of the label claims significantly increased following
   educational intervention, independent of the particular type of such
   intervention. Participants' attitudes toward label claims varied,
   however, by the type of educational intervention. Passive learning led
   participants not only to more trust, but also to consider label claims
   to be more important when purchasing chicken meat products. In contrast,
   active learning induced no significant change in the importance level of
   label claims with respect to their purchasing decision, as well as in
   the trustiness to label claims. In conclusion, educational intervention,
   whether based on passive or active learning, improves consumers' label
   understanding of chicken meat products. However, since attitude toward
   label claims varies by the type of educational intervention, food
   processors and researchers should take further steps in designing more
   effective ways to mediate the information regarding label claims. (C)

Title = {{Consumer preferences for food labeling: What ranks first?}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the EU food market, different food labeling schemes co-exist with the
   aim of informing customers and providing trust on different quality
   characteristics of food products. To understand which food labeling
   schemes are the most and the least important for consumers is very
   relevant because a labeling strategy will be useful for food companies
   if consumers, or at least one segment of consumers, value food labeling.
   The aim of this study was to measure the importance consumers attach to
   different labeling schemes available in the food market. Seven different
   food labeling schemes, some regulated by the EU (the EU organic logo,
   the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) indication and the nutritional
   fact panel) and some of them not yet regulated at the European level
   (the food miles indication; the local origin; the carbon footprint
   information; and an improved animal welfare indication), were assessed
   by consumers. To do this, the direct ranking preference method was used
   and a rank-ordered mixed logit model was estimated with the data from a
   survey conducted with food shoppers in a medium-sized Spanish town. The
   results indicate that the most preferred labeling scheme was the PDO
   indication, closely followed by the nutritional fact panel and the EU
   organic logo. In other words, consumers clearly valued labeling schemes
   that are regulated by EU law. Moreover, consumer preferences for food
   labeling were heterogeneous and three segments of consumers based on
   preferences were found: PDO lovers, organic EU logo lovers and the
   nutritional information lovers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Automation of modified marketing procedural system to maximize
   transparency A case study of vegetables in Madanapalle market}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-88}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Market transactions in large vegetable markets call for
   transparency with utmost urgency. The reason are that buyers are located
   at distant places and the volume of sales is very high. The purpose of
   this paper is to highlight the development of an automated system in
   market transactions in order to bring about transparency with concrete
   evidence available to small and medium farmers who are then able to
   repose trust in the system by acquiring the right price for the right
   product. The farmers can also confirm the effectiveness of the system by
   testing it themselves.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, a theoretical framework of
   marketing procedures of larger vegetable markets has been constructed
   with tomato as a vegetable of study and the Madanapalle tomato market as
   a market studied through surveys. Second, methods of functioning in
   marketing procedures including pricing and auctioning have been modified
   according to the objective. An android-based application has been used
   to develop an automated model. Surveys have been conducted to understand
   the perceptions of farmers in marketing procedures and price
   determination at the village level, and to test the automated model in
   the study market.
   Findings - Both quantitative as well as qualitative approaches indicate
   that, the proposed automated model in the modified marketing procedural
   system is of benefit to all stakeholders in the supply chain.
   Research limitations/implications - In model testing, gaps in inputs
   from a greater number of buyers during auctioning remains a limitation
   of the study. Social implications - For sustainable growth of tomatoes
   or any other vegetables it is essential that the farmers trust the
   marketing procedural system. This is possible if farmers obtain the
   right price for their products. Once the automated system is
   implemented, buyers acquire high-quality goods at desired prices, which
   further encourages more buyers from other regions to participate in the
   auctioning/tendering process stimulating an increased demand.
   Originality/value - This paper is unique in its pricing function and
   scores of stakeholders. Pricing function involves the farmers' input
   along with the buyers' inputs whereas scores of these two stakeholders
   have been obtained through the inputs of commissioning agents.}},

Title = {{Improving sweetpotato marketing in Papua New Guinea: Results from a
   value chain analysis}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALASIAN AGRIBUSINESS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Abstract = {{Sweetpotato is the most important food crop in the Highlands of Papua
   New Guinea (PNG). In recent years, sweetpotato has become a cash crop
   for smallholder farmers driven by the need to generate income in a
   market economy. Marketing opportunities exist for Highland sweetpotato,
   especially in coastal markets, because of income growth and
   urbanisation. Despite this, long distance sweetpotato marketing has been
   problematic. The objective of this research was to identify
   socio-economic constraints to, and opportunities for, improving the
   marketing efficiency of the long distance sweetpotato value chain in
   PNG. The results from the value chain analysis suggested that although
   there was a demand for high quality Highland sweetpotato in coastal
   markets, the long distance sweetpotato value chain was underdeveloped.
   This was due to several constraints: lack of access to support services
   (credit, extension and market information); poor infrastructure (roads
   and the transport system and storage and market facilities); inadequate
   postharvest management; lack of business skills, financial literacy and
   marketing planning; unclear price signals; lack of trust among chain
   players, uncoordinated value chain activities; and declining demand. The
   main conclusion was that to transition from subsistence farming to
   semi-commercial/commercial farming, smallholder farmers need to become
   more market-oriented and better equipped with business skills.
   Furthermore, they need to be prepared to change their current marketing
   and postharvest practices in order to supply high quality products to
   the right markets at competitive prices. Government also has a key role
   to play in terms of providing an appropriate enabling environment,
   including a reliable transport system, business development services and
   a locally appropriate pricing and grading system. This environment is
   necessary to support the effort of farmers in adopting improved
   marketing and postharvest practices.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF BREWING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{670-681}},
Abstract = {{Past studies did not fully address how value chain governance mechanisms
   and transaction attributes influence value chain integration. The paper,
   hence, investigates how value chain governance mechanisms (i.e.
   relational and contractual) and transaction attributes (i.e. dependency,
   asset specificity and uncertainty) correlate with chain integration.
   Survey data obtained from 320 farmers and 100 traders participating in
   the malt barley value chain in Ethiopia were used for the study. In
   addition, interview responses from 64 selected members of the chain were
   used for data triangulation. Descriptive statistics and ordered logistic
   regression were used for data analysis. The study highlights the
   following key findings: (a) the use of contract relates positively to
   value chain integration at all interfaces except at the traders-malt
   factory interface; (b) trust correlates positively with value chain
   integration at all interfaces; and (c) asset specificity relates
   negatively to value chain integration at the farmer-trader interface
   based on traders' survey data, while dependency and uncertainty relate
   positively to value chain integration at some of the studied interfaces.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Smallholders often have to certify according to international standards
   and produce under contract for large agro-businesses to access export
   markets. While mostly positive effects for the farmers have been found
   for contracts and certifications, often these effects do not persist
   because contracts fail and certifications are not renewed. We suggest
   that individual firm behavior is crucial for the long-term success of
   farmeragro- business relationships. In this article, we use data of 386
   smallholders in the pineapple export sector in Ghana, analyze them
   quantitatively and enrich it by a detailed case study of a large-scale
   agro-business in Ghana. The results show that, in an environment with
   weak contract enforcement, certification is an agent of change in
   farmer-agro-business relations and that building trust and aligning
   expectations of farmers and firms largely determine success. We conclude
   that individual firm behavior matters more than taken into account in
   previous research. Our case study shows that three `R' - reliability,
   reputation and respect -constitute the basis for contract relationships
   that benefit all.}},

Abstract = {{Agrarian profile educational programs quality providing in Russian and
   European universities is crucial for the development of agricultural
   production. They must meet the requirements of employers. The
   international project ``Development of professional public accreditation
   system of agrarian (agricultural) profile educational programs in the
   Russian Federation >> ({''}Tempus-PACAgro{''}) brought together
   representatives of Russian and European universities with the aim to
   reform the system of quality assurance. The project involves
   representatives of employers. The participation of representatives of
   Russian universities in the Erasmus Mundus program provides additional
   opportunities to study the experience of European universities. An
   important task for the Russian and European universities is to develop
   new opportunities for cooperation in order to guarantee agrarian profile
   educational programs quality providing. Primarily it is participation in
   the double diploma degree programs that promote mutual understanding and
   trust between universities-partners, laying the foundations for
   long-term cooperation, leading to the search for tools to improve the
   quality of education.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of globalization, and the corresponding decrease in the
   number of barriers to international commerce, trade in the food industry
   spanned national and international boundaries. This phenomenal
   development has resulted in a plethora of food related contamination
   scandals. With the increasing complexity within the supply chain
   networks, it is imperative that all actors within the food supply chain
   operate in an ethical and sustainable manner and this paper illustrates
   a process model that will effectively bolster the ethical underpinning
   of a fresh produce supply chain. This paper evinces a structural
   conceptual model that facilitates the integration of responsibility
   within the operations of the organizations, within a fruit and vegetable
   supply chain. It also conceptualises a seven-tiered sequential model,
   the Vision to Innovation model (The V2I model) of responsibility, which
   has its foundation based on the congruence of the ethics related values,
   and Values consonance along its supply chain actors. The second element
   involves Communication among the supply chain elements; the successive
   elements include Implementation of ethical standards along the supply
   chain, the Monitoring systems, Control systems, Collaboration and
   finally, Innovation. This model accounts for responsibility-centricity
   along the entire supply chain and the implementation of this model,
   within the practical business world, would render an ethical climate for
   the industry. The authors postulate that this will positively influence
   the T's of fresh produce supply chains, namely: Traceability,
   Testability, Transparency, Trust and Time. Currently minimal research on
   social responsibility and sustainability within the supply chain context
   is present and this paper contributes to such a gap in literature.}},

Abstract = {{Fairness among supply chain actors is imperative for long term and
   effective inter-organizational relationships. Due to operational issues
   within a fresh produce supply chain involving many small and medium
   players, the coordination and communication will be inefficient. This
   results in perceptions of unfair behaviour and results in strained
   supply chain relationships within a food supply chain. The paper
   proposes the implementation of the MOVIE (Model, Operations, View,
   Intelligence and Events) model to instigate distributive, procedural and
   interactive fairness perceptions along the entire supply chain. By
   communicating on a real-time basis and accounting for user specific
   access levels, the proposed cloud-based IT system will provide better
   access to information pertaining to the products, whilst it is being
   processed by different elements within the supply chain. Through
   accurate and timely communication of this information, the information
   that was traditionally communicated only to the bigger and more powerful
   supply chain actors will be available to every supply chain actor
   irrespective of size or purchasing power. Though Enterprise Resource
   Planning systems are plentiful, this has not percolated the food supply
   chain sector, and the proposed system accounts for such a lack within
   the food supply chain management context. The implementation of the
   proposed system will not only improve storage and marketing of easily
   perishable fruits and vegetables but also effectively improve perception
   of fairness along the fresh food supply chain, thus contributing to
   effective supply chain relationships.}},

   Descriptive analysis and analysis of variance were conducted to find
   significances of important information when purchasing and improvement
   needed on the labels in relation to allergy knowledge.
   Findings - The results indicated that respondents were concerned about
   allergy information and general information regarding the basic value of
   food and also food safety. In addition, this study found knowledge of
   food allergies is not related to consideration of allergy information on
   labels.
   Originality/value - This study measured consumers' perceptions of the
   current food allergy labeling when purchasing food products. This study
   concluded improvements were needed in order to deliver allergy
   information in a clear manner. Such as font size, shape, and color
   should be implemented together in order to communicate effectively with

Title = {{Perceptions and attitudes of the Mexican urban population towards
   genetically modified organisms}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2873-2892}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure Mexicans' perceptions
   and attitudes about the production and consumption of genetically
   modified organisms (GMOs).
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire with 63 questions that
   encompassed 11 latent factors was used to obtain information. The
   questionnaire was administered to 14,720 people in Mexico's urban areas.
   Findings - The results revealed important similarities and differences
   with studies in other countries, showing mainly that the respondents did
   not have sufficient information about GMOs, they have low level of
   knowledge about GMOs (31.28 percent), are highly distrustful of GMOs,
   perceive high risk regarding GMOs (59.13 percent), want transgenic
   products to be labeled (93.59 percent) and do not perceive GMOs' social
   values and positive health effects beyond increasing agricultural
   productivity. Also, it was observed that the higher the educational
   level of individuals, the lower the acceptance of GMOs.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors conclude that it is
   necessary to generate and provide scientifically accurate information on
   GMOs, so that people are better informed and can give a critical opinion
   on the use of GMOs.
   Practical implications - The major practical contribution of this
   research is that it provides empirical knowledge about the perceptions
   and attitudes toward the production and consumption of GMOs among the
   Mexican's urban society, which can be of great help for the Mexican
   government to rethink if it is an appropriate moment to completely open
   the doors to international companies to cultivate crops like maize and
   others that have been postponed due to pressure from the environmental
   groups, farmers and other sectors of the society.
   Social implications - This is especially important in the context of
   maize as it is part of the cultural heritage of Mexico since ancient
   times. However, it is not clear what the overall perception is in the
   Mexican society on the use of GMOs for cultivation.
   Originality/value - Southern regions of Mexico are the center of origin
   of several cultivated plants such as maize and legumes. The introduction
   of GMOs, called transgenics, in agriculture and food continues to cause
   enormous controversy in the perceptions and attitudes mainly among
   environmental groups and farmers in Mexico.}},

Title = {{In search of a model explaining organic food purchase behavior The
   overlooked story of Montano and Kasprzyk's integrated behavior model}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2911-2930}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the domain relevance
   of a comprehensive yet almost overlooked theoretical framework for
   studying organic food purchase behavior in a global context. This
   conceptual paper argues that there exists an apparently powerful model
   in health behavior domain that may readily be brought into organic food
   purchase behavior research. The paper argues for domain relevance and
   proposes that Montano and Kasprzyk's integrated behavior model may
   readily be used in organic food behavior studies with some relevant
   modification.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows an exploratory approach
   and shows how variables used in the past may be aggregated to the model
   in question. The challenge is addressed by following both the inductive
   and the deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning calls for investigating
   whether such behavior may be classified as health behavior. Inductive
   reasoning calls for proving relevance of all the variables in the
   aforesaid model to the organic food research context.
   Findings - The paper concludes that the Montano and Kasprzyk's model is
   theoretically relevant to the organic food behavior domain. However, it
   is observed that the domain-specific operationalization is necessary for
   further empirical studies.
   Research limitations/implications - Since the model was rarely tested
   empirically in predicting organic food purchase intention, the
   variable-specific relevance may not warrant the relevance of the whole
   model with intertwined relationships at the same time.
   Practical implications - The paper may pave a way toward further
   empirical research and may also explain the apparent intention-behavior
   gap as often reported in literature.
   Originality/value - The paper may provide a useful direction in future
   organic food purchase behavior studies by showing the domain relevance
   of an apparently powerful model, along with addition of some newer
   variables that may enrich the existing model.}},

Pages = {{3012-3029}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the volume and
   quality of information and communication channel use at various stages
   of the malt barley value chain (MBVC) in Ethiopia and to investigate how
   metrics of these variables influence the extent of integration of the
   chain.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on survey data
   collected from 320 farmers and 100 traders and interview responses
   compiled from 76 respondents. Descriptive statistics and ordered
   logistic regression were used for data analysis.
   Findings - The descriptive statistics show a lower volume and poor
   quality of information is being shared at farmer- trader interface and
   that value chain integration (VCI) is weak at all studied interfaces.
   Results of ordered logistic regression show that information volume and
   quality positively influence VCI, whereas a positive relationship
   between channel use and VCI was found only at farm level interfaces.
   Evidences found suggested that inconsistent information systems, lack of
   information sharing plans, low level of members' awareness about the
   value of information, and lack of trust to share information were
   factors that inhibited information sharing in the MBVC.
   Originality/value - The study offers pioneering evidence of the relative
   role of information volume and quality and channel use as factors that
   influence the extent of integration of the value chain.}},

Abstract = {{This work will analyze the female entrepreneurship phenomenon, in terms
   of dynamics, structural capacities and sustainability empowerment, in
   the specific field of the short food supply chain of fruit and
   vegetables products. The crisis of the prevailing agricultural model led
   to a reformulation of social economic development priorities: in this
   context, there is the experience of the short food supply chain, born as
   a reaction to the crisis of intensive agricultural models and to the
   longing expressed both by the consumers, out for fresh, safe and high
   quality products, and by the manufacturers, desirous to establish a
   direct trust-based relation.
   By considering the ever greater presence of women managing Italian
   farms, the research tries to understand if and how women's role could be
   decisive also for the short food supply chain, and thus it analyzes some
   Campania case studies to verify if women can concretely promote the
   cultural and economical development of a specific area, by leading the
   agricultural system towards the well being sustainability. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The use of certified seed potato is believed to substantially improve
   potato productivity. However, in developing countries including
   Indonesia, most farmers perceived that the price of certified seed is
   too expensive for potato cultivation. Farmers, therefore, often produce
   and use their own seed which is usually derived from the certified seed.
   In East Java, some farmers usually act as local seed growers and sell
   their seed to others in their villages. The complexity of the buying
   situation faced by East Javanese farmers whenever they are willing to
   purchase seed prompted this study of the extent to which buyer-supplier
   relationships influence farmers' decision to purchase seed potato. A
   total of 209 farmers from the highlands of East Java were interviewed in
   this study. The data were analyzed using factor analysis and multiple
   regression analysis. The findings generally suggest that farmer-supplier
   relationships in the East Java seed potato market were established based
   on high levels of satisfaction, trust and long-term commitment. A
   significant positive relationship was observed between supplier's offer
   quality and farmers' relationship satisfaction. Such would suggest that
   the high level of farmers' relationship satisfaction was derived from
   the adequate suppliers' offer quality. However, it was the seed and
   service quality dimension, rather than delivery and pricing, which
   significantly improved the farmers' relationship satisfaction. (C) 2016

Title = {{East versus West: acceptance of GM foods by European and Asian consumers}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION \& FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{628-636}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Contemporary business is rather global. Food imports and
   exports are expanding beyond borders to meet increasing domestic and
   international food and consumer demands. Genetically modified (GM) food
   emerged as a potential sustainable solution which aims at meeting
   consumer demands and to mitigate urgent global food security problem.
   Because of its nature of existence, GM food is a controversial topic in
   several countries and has varied acceptance rates by consumers. Both
   government and consumers are antagonistic towards GM foods in most
   European countries. In contrast, most Asian consumers are neutral and so
   do not oppose GM foods. The purpose of this viewpoint paper is to
   examine the factors determining the difference in acceptance of GM foods
   between cultures. Such information can facilitate policy implications
   for governments in global agri-food trade and for producers in
   segregating markets.
   Design/methodology/approach - Extensive literature review is done to
   base the discussions of this viewpoint paper.
   Findings - This paper presents five factors that describe the difference
   in acceptance of GM foods between Europeans and Asians: knowledge and
   trust over the institutions performing research, uncertainty avoidance
   and health, gender differences, risk perception and material benefits
   and food for survival.
   Originality/value - There is no systematic study that compares factors
   determining acceptance of GM foods across cultures.}},

Title = {{Segmentation of Chinese parents based on food risk perception dimensions

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2444-2461}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate risk dimensions
   affecting food risk perceptions and to develop effective risk
   communication strategies based on their risk perceptions dimensions. The
   reason for writing this paper is that applying single risk communication
   strategy for public often fails because food risks are systemic risks
   and public perceptions toward them consist of multiple dimensions.
   Launching an effective risk communication need to investigate the
   perception dimensions of the target audience.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 2,673 parents of 3-14-year-old
   children from the rural area of Sichuan province in China were chosen as
   target audience. Based on the survey conducted about parents' food risk
   perceptions, this study used factor-cluster analysis method to segment
   parents to sub-clusters with significantly different risk perception
   dimensions. Parents' representative demographic characteristics within
   each cluster were further identified through cross-tabs analysis with
   chi(2) tests.
   Findings - All the parents could be segmented into four sub-clusters,
   namely, sensitive parents, dependent parents, familiarity-oriented
   parents and institutional distrust parents, according to their risk
   perception difference on five dimensions. A series of risk communication
   strategies were specifically designed for each cluster based on their
   risk perception features as well as demographic characteristics.
   Originality/value - The insight derived from this study described a
   deeper image of public risk perceptions and provided suggestions for
   risk communication launchers to pinpoint the risk perception as well as
   perception dimensions of the target audience and accordingly develop
   effective risk communication strategies.}},

Title = {{Alternative approaches to treat respondent uncertainty in contingent
   willingness to pay estimation A theoretical and empirical analysis}},
Journal = {{CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{412-429}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to theoretically using two new
   models to analyze the effect of respondents' uncertainty about their
   stated willingness to pay (WTP) on welfare estimates in the contingent
   valuation method (CVM) theoretically using two new models, and
   empirically to reveal consumers' WTP to improve drinking water supply
   safety (WSS) in China.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, two alternative preference
   uncertainty treatment approaches are proposed to estimate consumers' WTP
   theoretically and they are applied to China's WSS improvement program
   from a payment card method, which depends on how consumers' certainty
   level about their valuation is. Furthermore, four regression models are
   presented to investigate the determinants of consumers' WTP.
   Findings - Theoretically, the alternative approaches that proposed in
   this research can remove overestimation bias from traditional CVM method
   but with lower estimation efficiency. In addition, the empirical results
   of the uncertainty adjusted models show that the expected WTP to improve
   drinking WSS is from 0.55 to 0.56 Renminbi yuan/ton, which are lower
   than the estimates from the conventional standard CVM models. Consumers'
   preferences for their concerns about WSS, attitudes toward WSS
   improvement programs, trusts in implement authorities and their
   knowledge of WSS have significant effects on the WTP for improving
   drinking WSS and on respondents' uncertainty too.
   Originality/value - Theoretically to the authors' knowledge, it is the
   first attempt to compare alternative approaches to treat respondent
   uncertainty using numerical certainty scale combined with payment card
   format valuation questions in CVM. Empirically it is the first study at
   this large scale that investigates consumers' WTP for improving drinking
   WSS incorporating with respondent uncertainty in China. In addition, to
   assess consumer preferences for improved drinking water safety and the
   sources of uncertainty, information on consumers' attitudes toward WSS
   are considered at the first time.}},

Title = {{Can a Multi-Level Label do Better than a Binary Label for Animal
   Welfare? A PLS-Analysis of Consumer Satisfaction}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1-29}},
Abstract = {{Labeling is an important marketing tool for food producers and
   retailers. With growing product heterogeneity, labels can help consumers
   differentiate higher quality products on supermarket shelves. Currently,
   most labels are of a binary nature-meaning a product either has certain
   characteristics or not-although there is a larger product heterogeneity
   in the food market than just two standards. A multi-level label might be
   a solution to addressing this problem. The objective of this article is
   to investigate if influences on consumer satisfaction with ethical food
   labeling systems differ between a binary and a multi-level labeling
   system. A consumer survey was carried out in Germany (n = 1,538)
   comparing the two types of labels with a split-sample approach. The
   influence of five factors (comprehensibility, involvement, time
   pressure, trust and use), derived from the literature, were analyzed in
   a structural equation model. All these factors influence satisfaction
   with labeling. Furthermore, differences between the two labeling systems
   were detected. This article delivers important results for food
   producers and policy makers. The group comparison indicated that trust
   as a precondition is more necessary for a binary label whereas time
   pressure factors reduce satisfaction with multi-level labeling.}},

Abstract = {{Trust is an integral part of maintaining any successful business

   sales representatives should focus on their own personal development to
   build more trusted relationships as opposed to things largely outside of
   their control. Farmers did not care as much about age, years working, or
   even the reputation of the sales rep's employer. In short, our research
   shows that agricultural sales representatives can build more trusted
   relationships with farmers.}},

Title = {{An analysis of factors affecting growth of organic food Perception of
   consumers in Delhi-NCR (India)}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2308-2325}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Food gives us essential nutrients to lead a healthy lifestyle
   but lately it has been found that many food products have become
   hazardous due to contamination and lead to many diseases. The rampant
   use of pesticides and chemical-based fertilizers in agriculture has,
   increased the productivity but at the same time they have created an
   alarming situation for the environment. The demand of the hour is to
   therefore to encourage organic farming and offer a better choice to
   consumers as well as save the environment. The purpose of this paper is
   to explore and understand the factors affecting perception of consumers
   on organic food products in Indian context.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study used a structured survey of 150
   respondents covering Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) of
   Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad (India). Exploratory research was used to
   know the variables from the literature that affect the perception of
   consumers regarding organic food. Descriptive research was used to
   understand the demographic profile of the organic food consumer's.
   Conclusive research design was used to test the hypotheses based upon
   the motivating and inhibiting factor in the growth of organic food.
   Findings - The data collected from the survey were analyzed using
   t-test, chi(2) test, factor analysis and multiple linear regression
   tests. Results indicated that the intention to purchase organic products
   was impacted by the consumer's belief on the safety and health aspect of
   the product, trust and certification, information and availability and
   lifestyle and are hence drivers of growth. And certain impeding factors
   were identified like doubt in the professed quality of organic food,
   lack of awareness and price parity.
   Social implications - There are enough evidences of fertile land being
   converted into wasteland because of use of agro-chemical-based
   fertilizers in farming. There are also enough incidents of polluted
   water (ground and surface) due to agrochemical-based farming. Heavy use
   of pesticides leads to adverse effect on the health of farmers also.
   There were many reports of farmers committing suicide because of debt
   due to heavy investment on pesticides and fertilizers. Organic farming
   is a win-win proposition for environment, farmers and consumer's.
   Originality/value - The study was an effort to understand awareness and
   perception of organic food consumers in urban India post-agriculture
   revolution. The result would help the organic food producing and
   marketing companies to understand the factors that influence the belief
   of consumers when they purchase organic food and henceforth they can
   formulate communication strategies and marketing policy based on
   consumer's expectations.}},

   between anticipation and assessment}},
Journal = {{STUDIES IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},

Pages = {{55-60}},
Abstract = {{In the 2007-2013 European Union programming period, Romania benefitted
   from assistance provided through the Human Resources Development
   Operational Programme, financed by the European Social Fund, to promote
   social inclusion. Women are, in many instances, a vulnerable group that
   needs support from various sources for greater integration in the labour
   market. This integration resides in encouraging entrepreneurship. The
   purpose of this paper is to analyse how support is anticipated by women
   planning to start a business and assessed by those who already have
   experience in entrepreneurship. To achieve the research objectives, a
   study was conducted on a sample of 774 women in three NUTS 2 development
   regions of Romania in 2013. The variables used in the analysis were
   grouped using factor analysis in two factors. The results of the primary
   analysis reveal a greater emphasis on the first factor, represented by
   institutions, and less importance given to the second factor,
   represented by family and friends. However, potential female
   entrepreneurs are characterised by a tendency to overestimate the first
   factor, as positive on the one hand or rather negative on the other, in
   terms of starting an entrepreneurial approach. Our results point out the
   need for a stronger involvement of the responsible institutions in
   building trust and ensuring the support needed by female entrepreneurs.}},

Title = {{Direct selling in the wine sector: lessons from cellars in Italy's
   Apulia region}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1926-1939}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Buying process directly from producers is an expanding trend
   in advanced economies; then direct sales can be considered a crucial
   driver in wine sector in order to cope with global challenges and
   achieve a competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to
   investigate if management aspects and marketing innovation propensity
   could have an important role in choosing direct sale tool.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative analysis in Apulia region
   (Italy) was carried out. Data have been collected through a face to face
   and web-based exploratory survey submitted to a sample of 280 cellars
   participating in an Integrated Projects of Food Chains. A logit
   regression model was run in the research design.
   Findings - Findings showed that most of interviewed wineries, mainly
   characterized by agricultural production and direct approach to
   customers, are more likely inclined to direct sales choice.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample size could be expanded
   (e.g. to include farms from other regions or not belonging to an
   integrated projects).
   Practical implications - Managerial implications give insight on the
   role of direct sales as an opportunity to obtain aggregated value for
   agri-products and to increase bargaining power of farmers.
   Social implications - Food direct sales could have the important task of
   straightening the social proximity between rural and urban stakeholders,
   increasing trust and connection between producers and consumers.
   Originality/value - This paper can shed some light on this topic, since
   direct food sales across regions is less investigated than direct
   marketing.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1712-1730}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumer attitudes
   towards and interest in enriching processed meat with healthy
   ingredients ({''}functional processed meat{''}).
   Design/methodology/approach - Seven focus groups across age and gender
   were conducted. Discussions were analysed using an inductive thematic
   approach.
   Findings - Strategies that participants felt as important for improving
   the healthiness of processed meat mainly included the use of better
   quality meat and less salt, fat, preservatives and other additives.
   ``Functional processed meat{''} was a new concept for participants. Four
   themes were constructed to reflect participants' attitudes towards
   functional processed meat: opposing views on processed meat as a carrier
   of healthy ingredients; belief in the health benefits of functional
   processed meat; perceived value of functional processed meat for
   different consumer groups; and trust and perceived risk surrounding the
   functional food concept. A large proportion of the participants were
   unconvinced about the concept of functional processed meat; however many
   of the participants expressed an openness to purchase this food product
   if taste and price remained uncompromised.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample size of the current study
   is small. Complementary quantitative research with a more representative
   sample should be implemented. Adopting a quantitative approach, the
   findings from this study should be explored further to investigate their
   application in a representative sample of the population.
   Originality/value - This study represents a first exploratory
   investigation of consumer views on functional processed meat. It can
   inform further consumer and market research in relation to the
   development of ``healthier{''} processed meat.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Organic certification system became important means to restore
   consumer confidence in China. The purpose of this paper is to focus on
   consumer trust in organic milk of different brands and its influencing
   factors.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from 876 randomly
   selected consumers in Shandong Province, China. And an ordered logistic
   model was established to analyze influencing factors of consumer trust.
   Findings - Chinese consumers generally lack trust in organic milk.
   Consumer trust for different brands of organic milk was different, and
   was not high in general. Various factors, namely, age, education years,
   food safety awareness, evaluation of government regulation policy,
   evaluation of organic milk price, and purchase convenience, have a
   significant impact on consumer trust. Factors, such as income,
   environmental protection consciousness, and risk consciousness, are not
   significant.
   Originality/value - This research is of academic value and of value to

Title = {{Performance perceptions among food supply chain members A triadic
   assessment of the influence of supply chain relationship quality on
   supply chain performance}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1783-1799}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - A good supply chain relationship quality (RQ) is a crucial
   precursor for any stable exchange relationship which ensures
   relationship continuity. Although empirical research suggests that
   strengthening RQ improves supply chain performance (SCP), most studies
   have focused on dyadic business relationships. To fully understand the
   relational behaviour of a firm embedded in a supply chain, we need to
   look beyond the dyad into triads. The purpose of this paper is to
   investigate how SCP is influenced by RQ in a triadic agribusiness supply
   chain.
   Design/methodology/approach - Evidence is drawn from a quantitative
   survey of 150 agribusiness firms in the maize supply chain in Uganda.
   Data were collected in triadic context from 50 direct supply chains each
   composing of a supplier, focal firm and customer. Multi-group structural
   on SCP amongst the supply chain members.
   Findings - Results provides empirical support for the positive influence
   of RQ on SCP. SEM reveals differences in perception between the upstream
   and downstream and amongst the supply chains members. While focal firms
   considered conflict, coercive power, commitment and trust to be
   important; suppliers considered trust, dependency and non-coercive
   power; and customers considered trust, dependency and coercive power to
   be important RQ factors affecting SCP.
   Practical implications - For agribusiness managers to enhance business
   performance there is need to cultivate strong and mutual relationship
   with supply chain members. It is also important to know how to handle
   conflicts and use of power so as to realise the benefits of supply chain
   relationships.
   Originality/value - The paper is novel in that it assesses SCP in a
   triadic context in an agribusiness sector from a developing country
   context. The authors used novel approaches including analysis of a
   triad, and multiple groups SEM to assess perceptions of each supply
   chain member's.}},

Title = {{Innovations in the agro-food system Adoption of certified organic food
   and green food by Chinese consumers}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1334-1349}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors driving
   the adoption of ``green innovations{''} notably green food and certified
   organic food and to examine the attitudes of Chinese consumers towards
   genetically modified food.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods approach was used. A total
   of 402 consumers responded to a structured questionnaire and 58
   consumers responded to a survey designed to gather qualitative data.
   Data analysis involved content analysis, the probit model, frequency
   distributions and the t-test for two unrelated means.
   Findings - This study shows that affluent, middle class Chinese citizens
   are opting out of the conventional food market. There is a gender
   divide, with men showing a preference for green food and females showing
   a preference for certified organic food. Certified food purchase is
   associated with demographic variables, such as income, education, age,
   gender, presence of young children, household size, living in developed
   cities and overseas experience. A follow-up study shows that the absence
   of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) motivates the purchase of
   organic food. Overall, the results suggest that Chinese consumers are
   turning towards certified food for health reasons and are sceptical
   about genetic modification (GM) food.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper provides some insights
   into how Chinese consumers view innovations in the food sector. The
   study found that almost half of the sample is unaware that the concept
   of green food is different to that of organic food. The priority for the
   certified organic industry is to address this lack of knowledge and
   clearly explain what certified organic food is and how it differs from
   green food. Small-scale farmers could use consumer aversion to GMOs as a
   promotional tool. The ultimate goal of this paper is to help marketers
   better promote certified organic food, but inferences can be drawn in
   terms of Chinese sustainable consumption. Negative attitudes towards
   genetically modified foods exist due to human health concerns. Hence,
   Chinese policy makers need to confront these perceptions, real or
   perceived, if they wish to maintain public trust in biotechnology.
   Practical implications - Based on the qualitative data, stressing the
   GM-free status is likely to enhance sales since there appears to be a
   segment of consumers that distrusts GM technology.
   Originality/value - The contribution of this research lies in examining
   what drives the adoption of ``green innovations{''}, notably green food
   and certified organic food in China. This research is important given
   that little is known about what Chinese consumers think of, and how they
   react to, innovations in the agro-food value chain.}},

Title = {{Price satisfaction and producer loyalty The role of mediators in
   business to business relationships in Kenyan mango supply chain}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1067-1084}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate which dimensions
   of price satisfaction influence producers trust in buyers and assess the
   mediating role of such trust in the relationship between price
   satisfaction and producer loyalty in fresh fruit supply chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study design using both
   semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires was used. The
   study was conducted in the Eastern part of Kenya and included 600
   smallholders. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling.
   Findings - The results show that price fairness, price reliability, and
   relative price are dimensions of price satisfaction that affect
   producers' trust in the buyer. Moreover, trust between the producer and
   the buyer is found to he a strong mediator between price satisfaction
   and producer loyalty. The findings support recent studies about trust
   and its mediating role.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper is based on a
   cross-sectional study design, limiting the causal inferences which can
   be drawn. Producers' preferences change with time and future studies
   should be based on longitudinal designs.
   Originality/value - This paper shows the relationship between the multi
   -dimensional nature of price satisfaction and producer loyalty with
   trust as a mediating variable in the business-to-business (B2B) context,
   Although B2B relationships have been shown to be of great importance for
   smallholders in enhancing business performance with their buyers, little
   attention has been given to the role of trust as a mediator. This study
   offers interesting insights into the how trust plays a mediating role
   between price satisfaction and loyalty in a developing country context.}},

Title = {{Towards a grounded view of collaboration in Indian agri-food supply
   chains A qualitative investigation}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1085-1106}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the process and
   role of supply chain collaboration in Indian agri-food industry and
   highlight the perceptions of buyers and suppliers toward each other. The
   paper seeks to find out how can collaboration in agri-food supply chain
   lead to low wastage and better efficiency. Also, the paper attempts to
   capture the nuances of collaborative practices and perceptions of buyers
   and suppliers toward collaboration.
   Design/methodology/approach - Case study methodology in a top Indian
   food processing firm was conducted to explore the application and
   benefits of collaboration in supply chains, In-depth interviews with
   upstream supply chain members were conducted to understand the process
   of supply chain collaboration. Grounded theory methodology was used to
   analyze the transcripts.
   Findings - First, through content analysis of interview transcripts a
   comprehensive framework and a generic model was derived to understand
   the process of supply chain collaboration. Supplier selection, joint
   planning and information sharing were found to be main antecedents while
   profits; waste reduction and supply chain efficiency were major outcomes
   of collaboration. Second, it was found that the suppliers are usually
   more skeptical of the buyers and do not trust them easily. While, for
   buyers, it is very important to have good relations with suppliers and
   should make provide incentives to suppliers for collaboration.
   Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first
   study to elaborate the process and outcomes of collaborative activities
   along an Indian agri-food supply chain through in-depth qualitative
   study, In developing countries, agriculture industry is the backbone of
   economy, Therefore, the insights developed in this study may be useful
   for managers in agribusiness to dwell into such supply chain practices
   that would increase profit and efficiency, and decrease wastage.}},

Pages = {{1163-1178}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore modern food retail
   buyers' behaviour in developing economies using the case of Tanzania.
   This paper provides an insight into the decision-making practice of
   modern food retail buyers behaviour in emerging modern food distribution
   systems, where the buying task involves balancing the retailer's
   commercial interests with more stringent government regulations that
   shape food business in the region.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative case study approach was used
   for the study. The researcher used semi-structured interviews with
   retailers for data collection and corroborated them with secondiut data.
   Data were thematically analysed.
   Findings - The study shows that the criteria used by modern food
   retailers in the selection of local food suppliers are reliability,
   quality, trade credit and legal certification. The task is further
   complicated by the overlapping food certification requirements of
   various government agencies, which impose limitations on the buyers'
   decision, Due to the exploratory nature of the study and its focus on
   the context of a particular geographical marketplace, the findings may
   not he generalizable to other countries.
   Originality/value - This is the first academic study of the criteria

Abstract = {{Relational governance is argued by many authors to positively affect

   multiple regression analyses is employed to test the model on primary
   data collected from a sample of 170 Albanian farmers engaged in
   cultivation and collection of medicinal aromatic plants. Findings show
   empirical support for the proposition that the adoption of relational
   exchange lowers ex post transaction costs. It also demonstrates that
   behavior uncertainty acts as a quasi-moderator, wherein it impacts both
   directly and indirectly the ex post transaction costs. The role of
   uncertainty in shaping relational ties, outcomes, and implications is

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{679-696}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Private label brands of food products are an important
   component of many consumers' purchases, as well as an integral element
   of the retail industry. The purpose of this paper is to examine the
   moderating role of trust on food private label brands' purchase
   intention and loyalty.
   Design/methodology/approach - For this purpose, the authors propose and
   empirically test a conceptual model comprising variables such as price,
   familiarity and store image. A sample of 445 respondents was gathered,
   and the hypotheses were tested performing structural equation modelling.
   Findings - The findings highlight the moderating influence of trust on
   consumers' loyalty to food private label brands. In addition, the
   results obtained reveal the substantially great influence of private
   label brand familiarity on purchase intention and loyalty. So, it seems
   that consumer trust and loyalty are strongly associated regarding food
   private label brands.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors suggest that trust of
   food private label brands allows retailers to increase consumer loyalty.
   Practical implications - Consequently retail managers should consider
   the enhancement of trust in the context of a marketing strategy
   formulation for food private label brands.
   Originality/value - The present study provides insights into the
   moderating effect of trust on loyalty to food private label brands, as
   well as evidence of the strong influence of familiarity on private label
   brands' proneness, related to food products.}},

Title = {{Scale of consumer loyalty for organic food}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{697-713}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The alternative food markets are growing and despite the
   evidences of heterogeneity and of organic food consumers' special
   features, little has been done to develop a scale to measure loyalty to
   this market. The purpose of this paper is to propose and validate a
   scale based on consumers' loyalty literature and on the particular
   features of the organic market.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data from 604 consumers were obtained
   through a web-based survey, which was used to analyze the structural
   equation in the AMOS software, in order to validate the proposed scale
   model.
   Findings - A one-dimensional validated scale consisting of eight
   questions and showing high composite reliability level (0.95) was used
   to measure consumer loyalty to organic food. The herein used sample
   presented mean True Organic Loyal (4.36) and standard deviation (0.62);
   these values depict Brazilians high loyalty to this food type.
   Research limitations/implications - The research was conducted and
   validated in Brazil and it can be replicated within the country as well
   as be transculturally validated.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of the current study is the
   development and validation of a scale named scale of consumer loyalty
   for organic food. The suggested interpretation ranges from non-loyal to
   true organic loyal consumers and it helps understanding organic food
   consumers' behavior. This research took under consideration consumers of
   any sort of organic food as well as consumers of regular food markets
   (farmer's markets, supermarkets, collective groups, shops and internet).}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to profile Italian food supplements used by consumers
   based upon their psychometric patterns and demographic characteristics.
   The FTNS scale is used to assess empirically and evaluate the role of
   technophobic/technophilic consumer traits in determining the decision
   whether or not to consume supplements and vitamins and the frequency of
   their consumption. An ad-hoc survey was carried out in 2012 involving
   400 residents of a metropolitan area in southern Italy. Our results show
   that women have a higher consumption frequency of dietary supplements,
   while age, BMI and education influence the propensity to consume. As
   regards food habits, the propensity to use dietary supplements is
   positively associated to the consumption of bread and pasta, red meat
   and pulses, and negatively with the consumption of fruit and cheese.
   Finally, the research supports the role of technophobic traits as
   consistent and significant determinants of the consumption frequency of
   dietary supplements.}},

Title = {{Predicting intentions to purchase organic food: the moderating effects
   of organic food prices}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{183-199}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Organic food represents the fastest growing sector in the food
   market, with outstanding performance in both production and sales.
   However, existing studies on organic food have lacked a strong
   theoretical foundation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   relationships among purchase intention and the properties, certification
   mechanisms, retail channels, and prices of organic food from multiple
   theoretical perspectives.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a rigorous sampling design, 507
   valid questionnaires collected from consumers at four well-known organic
   food markets, and the hypotheses were tested based on a linear
   structural equation model.
   Findings - The results of the structural equation model analysis showed
   the following: consumer attitudes toward organic food
   labeling/certification institutions had a positive impact on the trust
   in food labeling; channel dependence positively influenced the
   relational embeddedness in a channel; the effect of the nutritional
   value of organic food on environmental protection also had a positive
   impact on attitudes toward organic foods; attitudes toward trust in the
   organic label, relational embeddedness in a channel, and attitudes
   toward organic foods had a positive impact on consumer purchase
   intentions; and in relation to low-price scenarios, consumers required
   more confidence to purchase higher-priced goods, meaning that the
   relational embeddedness in a channel exerted more influence on purchase
   intentions. By contrast, compared to the high-price scenarios, consumers
   tended to choose lower priced goods based on personal preferences, e.g.,
   making the purchase decision based on trust in the organic label and
   attitudes toward organic food.
   Originality/value - The contributions of this study include the
   following: the relationships among the variables were investigated
   comprehensively from multiple theoretical perspectives; and the results
   can help the government and the organic food industry to understand
   their respective responsibilities in promoting organic food to reduce
   the waste of resources, in which the government can provide basic
   information on organic food, e.g., a certification mechanism and related
   definitions, while the organic food industry provides specific knowledge
   about organic foods, e.g., product features.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, consumers' willingness to pay for farming, slaughter and
   processing, distribution and marketing, and government certification
   information was investigated in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China using an
   experimental auction and real choice experiment based on incentive
   compatibility of the nonhypothetical elicitation method. No significant
   differences in consumers' willingness to pay were revealed by the
   experimental auction and real choice experiment on the whole, and
   results from both nonhypothetical experimental methods demonstrated that
   consumers were willing to pay certain premiums for all four types of
   traceability information and had the highest willingness to pay for
   government certification information. These results indicate that
   consumers trust in pork safety protection under governmental
   supervision. Moreover, it was found that government certification
   information played a significant role in improving consumer utility,
   demonstrating that consumers paid close attention to safety risks in
   farming. Therefore, this study predicts that the introduction of
   governmental supervision into the pork traceability system and
   establishment of a system for collecting traceability information
   starting from the stage of pig farming will play important roles in
   meeting consumer demands for pork quality and safety, as well as
   promoting the development of traceable food policies.}},

Title = {{Adoption and impact of index-insurance and credit for smallholder
   farmers in developing countries A systematic review}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-118}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the most recent
   scientific literature on the determinants explaining the demand for
   index-insurance, the impact of index-insurance and the existing links
   between insurance and credit. In this meta-analysis, the authors
   identify key discoveries on the potential of index-insurance in
   enhancing credit supply for smallholders and thus farm productivity.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following a systematic literature search
   in Scopus and Web of Science, relevant empirical articles were
   identified by using the following criteria search algorithm:
   ``insurance{''} and ({''}weather{''} or ``micro{''} or ``area? based{''}
   or ``rain{*}{''} or ``livestock{''} or ``index{''}), and
   (({''}empiric{*}{''} or ``experiment{''} or ``trial{''} or ``RCT{''} or
   ``impact{''}) or ({''}credit{''} or ``loan{*}{''} or ``debt{''} or
   ``finance{''})). The authors identified 1,133 related papers, 110 of
   which were selected as closely matching the study criteria. After
   removing duplicates and analysing each document, 45 papers were included
   in the current analysis. The framework for addressing insurance and
   credit issues, in the paper, entails three subsequent themes, namely,
   adoption of insurance, impact of insurance and links between insurance
   and credit.
   Findings - It is not confirmed yet that demand for insurance is indeed
   hump-shaped in risk aversion and the functional form of this
   relationship should be tested in more detail. This also holds for the
   magnitude of the effect of trust and education on actual demand.
   Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent other risk mitigation
   strategies form complements or substitutes to index-insurance. Lastly,
   the interaction between basis risk and price is important to the design
   of index-insurance products. If basis risk and price elasticity are
   indeed highly correlated, products that diminish basis risk are crucial
   in increasing demand. On the impact of bundled products, e.g.
   combination of insurance and credit, limited empirical research has been
   conducted. For example, it is unknown to what extent credit suppliers
   would react to the insured status of farmers or what the preferences of
   farmers are when it comes to a mix of financial products. In addition,
   several researchers have suggested that microfinance institutions or
   banks could insure themselves against covariate risk, yet no empirical
   evidence about this insurance mechanism has been conducted so far.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors based the research on
   scientific literature uploaded in Scopus and Web of Science. Other
   potentially insightful grey literature was not included due to lack of
   accessibility. Given the research findings, there is plenty of
   opportunity for further research particularly with regard to the effects
   of bundled products, e.g. insurance plus credit, on demand for
   index-insurance, supply of credit, loan conditions and impact on farm
   productivity and farmers' well-being.
   Practical implications - Microfinance institutions, insurance companies,
   NGOs, research institutions and universities, particularly in developing
   countries, will be interested to learn about the systematic review of
   scientific research done in the area of insurance and credit for
   agriculture and the possibilities for application in their own practice
   of supplying these financial products.
   Social implications - A rigorous understanding of the potential of
   index-insurance and credit is essential for identifying the right mix of
   financial products that help smallholder farmers to increase farm
   productivity and their own well-being.
   Originality/value - The paper is valuable due to its rigorous evaluation
   of existing theoretical and empirical research around issues explaining
   the degree of adoption and impact of index-insurance and that of bundled
   financial products (i.e. index-insurance plus credit). The paper has the
   potential to become essential reading for academics, practitioners and
   policy-makers interested in researching and putting in practice the best
   options leading to greater farm productivity and well-being in
   developing countries.}},

   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative study was conducted among

   had a negative relationship with attitude. With respect to lifestyle,
   novelty was positively related to attitude, and freshness was negatively
   related. In addition, novelty had only an indirect effect on intention,

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{714-733}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate attitudes of
   Italian consumers towards a set of applications of nanotechnology in the
   food domain. The chief goal is to identify the main factors influencing
   the willingness to buy nanofoods (WTBN), distinguishing between factors
   related to the products, in terms of perceived risks and benefits and
   psychological factors.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was administered to a
   sample of about 300 people to gather information about the willingness
   to buy six nanofoods (namely: creamier ice cream with the same fat
   content; salt and sugar that do not form lumps with moisture; fruit
   juices enriched with bioactive molecules; bread enriched with Omega-3;
   plastic bottles for beer; antimicrobial food packaging for meat) and
   psychological characteristics, measured by several attitudinal scales.
   In order to study the influence of the attitudinal factors on the WTBN a
   simultaneous equations model was estimated, defining both its structural
   and reduced form.
   Findings - Respondents show a certain reluctance to buy foods produced
   using nanotechnologies The estimates of the econometric model indicate
   that WTBN is affected by the risks and benefits perceived with respect
   to the six nanofoods under consideration; the level of neophobia, as
   captured through the food technology neophobia scale; and the level of
   trust in food industry.
   Originality/value - The study extends the literature on nanofood
   consumer acceptance by adding useful evidence from the Italian case,
   which has not yet been studied.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic review relevant to the following research questions was
   conducted (1) the extent to which different theoretical frameworks have
   been applied to food risk/benefit communication and (2) the impact such
   food risk/benefit communication interventions have had on related
   risk/benefit attitudes and behaviors. Fifty four papers were identified.
   The analysis revealed that (primarily European or US) research interest
   has been relatively recent. Certain food issues were of greater interest
   to researchers than others, perhaps reflecting the occurrence of a
   crisis, or policy concern. Three broad themes relevant to the
   development of best practice in risk (benefit) communication were
   identified: the characteristics of the target population; the contents
   of the information; and the characteristics of the information sources.
   Within these themes, independent and dependent variables differed
   considerably. Overall, acute risk (benefit) communication will require
   advances in communication process whereas chronic communication needs to
   identify audience requirements. Both citizen's risk/benefit perceptions
   and (if relevant) related behaviors need to be taken into account, and
   recommendations for behavioral change need to be concrete and
   actionable. The application of theoretical frameworks to the study of
   risk (benefit) communication was infrequent, and developing predictive
   models of effective risk (benefit) communication may be contingent on
   improved theoretical perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Following the discovery of horsemeat in beef products in Europe in 2013,
   restoring consumers' confidence in processed meat products as well as in
   all the agencies involved producers, food safety authorities, retailers
   soon became a key priority. However, the European public's confidence in
   processed meat products and their views about government and industry
   actions to manage fraudulent practices in the wake of this incident are
   poorly understood. The objective of this study was to identify the core
   issues affecting consumers' confidence in the food industry,
   particularly in the meat processing sector, and to explore the impact of
   the horsemeat incident on consumers' purchasing and eating behaviour. It
   involved the use of an online deliberation tool VIZZATA (TM) to collect
   detailed views of 61 consumers in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
   Many participants reported buying fewer products containing processed
   meat as a result of the horsemeat incident. These respondents also
   claimed that their confidence in processed foods containing meat was
   lower than before the incident. Participants suggested restoring
   consumer confidence through improved traceability, sourcing local
   ingredients, providing clearer and correct labelling and stating the
   origin of meat on pack. Overall, findings indicate that rebuilding
   consumer confidence in processed meat products following a food
   adulteration episode is a multifaceted and difficult process. Food
   authorities and the food industry can benefit from the insights provided
   by this study to address issues affecting consumer confidence and to
   improve their communication strategies during future food adulteration
   incidents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{UKRAINIAN FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{186-194}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. The article presents outputs of a trial which discovered
   consumers' opinions on food quality labels in the Czech Republic and
   their influence on shopping behaviour in the process of purchasing
   foodstuff.
   Materials and methods. Questionnaire research is a basis for further
   research realized in 2016. In the trial, 36 respondents over 18 years of
   age were interviewed in front of grocery stores in the period from
   December 2015 to January 2016, their distribution roughly corresponded
   the Czech population sample. Individual semi-structured interviews were
   used where the respondents answered a set of 13 questions.
   Results and discussion. Three most influential factors that affect
   consumers shopping food are price in the first place, origin of the
   product in the second, and its appearance as third. However, more
   accurate results will appear with a higher number of respondents in
   further research. So far the trial leads to the conclusion that quality
   labels are not the key factor having significant influence on shopping
   behaviour. In naming quality labels, Klasa appears to be the most
   recognized label of quality and shows the highest awareness. Other
   featured labels were Cesky vyrobek and Bio. Nevertheless, consumers do
   not have an accurate understanding of quality labels meaning in general.
   In 95\% of cases, the respondents agree that labelled products meet
   their expectations, but only 58\% consider labelled products to have
   higher quality. Almost 61\% of the respondents agree that quality labels
   are trustworthy, and 72\% of the sample are willing to pay extra money
   for labelled food products.
   Conclusion. About two thirds of consumers trust quality labels and
   nearly three quarters are willing to pay more for labelled products than
   unlabelled.}},

Title = {{Understanding farmer cooperatives' self-inspection behavior to guarantee
   agri-product safety in China}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{320-327}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Both global and domestic markets place increasing importance on the
   quality and safety of food products that are produced in China. The
   presence of microbial agents, toxic animal and plant products and
   chemical contamination remain because of the existence of small and
   dispersed farmers, who are not educated to use agricultural inputs
   correctly. This inability raises the issue of safety control in the
   agricultural sector. This study proposes that cooperatives'
   self-inspection of agricultural products before they enter the market
   can better organize small farmers to utilize a standardized production
   and safety management system. Therefore, we attempt to explore the
   factors that influence farmer cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. An
   Ordered Logistic Regression Model is employed to estimate the factors
   that influence cooperatives' choices of inspection frequency. The
   results show that the respondents expressed a medium to high level of
   implementing self-inspection but a lower level of concern in testing
   products by batch. The regression results indicate that subjective norms
   from the social environment, the perceived behavioral control of
   managers, ability and rules including input management, production
   documentation, and social demographic variables, significantly affect
   cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. The future implementation of
   safety inspection depends on the extent to which subjective norms,
   ability, and internal rules can improve agri-product safety in China.

Abstract = {{Background: The nature and severity of 3 categories of maternal
   stressors (nutritional, infectious, and psychosocial) that may impact
   maternal health and early infant growth are not often considered
   together.
   Objectives: To describe quantitative methodologies; assess construct
   validity of questionnaires; report variability in sociodemographic,
   obstetric, nutritional, infectious, and psychosocial characteristics;
   and compare characteristics between pregnancy and lactation and between
   study cohorts of Mam-Mayan mother-infant dyads.
   Methods: Grounded in participatory action research and a socioecological
   framework, this observational study enrolled a longitudinal cohort of
   155 women, followed during pregnancy (6-9 months), early (0-6 weeks),
   and later (4-6 months) postpartum, and 2 cross-sectional cohorts (60
   early and 56 later postpartum). Household and social factors; obstetric
   history; nutritional, infectious, and psychosocial stressors; and infant
   characteristics were explored.
   Results: Diet diversity (3.4 1.3) and adult food security (38\%) were
   low. Urinary and gastrointestinal infections were rare (<5\%), whereas
   experience of local idioms of distress was frequent (20\%-50\%).
   Participants reported low maternal autonomy (81\%), high paternal
   support (70\%), small social support networks (2.7 +/- 1.3 individuals),
   and high trust in family (88\%) and community-based institutions
   (61\%-65\%) but low trust in government services (6\%). Domestic
   violence was commonly reported (22\%). Infant stunting was common (36\%
   early postpartum and 43\% later postpartum) despite frequent antenatal
   care visits (7.5 +/- 3.8). Participant engagement with the research team
   did not influence study outcomes based on comparisons between
   longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts.
   Conclusions: The variability in sociodemographic, nutritional, and
   psychosocial variables, will allow exploration of factors that promote
   resilience or increase vulnerability of the mother-infant dyad.}},

Abstract = {{The issues of what drives consumers to trust the food industry in
   general and food brands specifically, and the outcomes of consumer
   trust, are increasingly of interest to food industry stakeholders and to
   policy makers. The extant knowledge of trust in food brands, and in
   particular the empirical investigation of brand trust, is relatively
   underresearched in food economics. Research examining institutional
   trust has been carried out in sociology, marketing, and political
   science, while a limited number of studies to date have investigated the
   degree of consumer trust in food. This paper extends previous research
   on consumer trust in the context of food by developing a conceptual
   framework based on insights from the trust literature that explores the
   drivers and outcomes of consumer confidence in food quality and food
   safety. The conceptual framework is tested with a Structural Equation
   Model using survey data from a sample of Canadian consumers of fresh
   chicken. Model results indicate that both trust in the food industry
   (i.e., food companies and food retailers) and brand trust bolster
   consumer confidence in credence attributes. Furthermore, personal
   traits, such as risk aversion and ethically motivated behavior, moderate
   the relationship between brand trust and consumer confidence in credence
   qualities.}},

   The main objective of the study is to develop and test a model, which

   article examines also the effect of absorptive capacity on innovation as
   well as the connection of both innovative entrepreneurial orientation
   and innovation outcome on farm business performance. Cross-sectional
   data were collected from a sample of 199 banana farmers in 2008-2009 in
   Ecuador. A structural equation modeling approach has been applied to
   validate the hypothesized model. The findings show that all

Abstract = {{Background: This research utilizes the Reasoned Action Approach
   framework to study which beliefs drive the intention of farmers to
   participate in a voluntary vaccination scheme against Bluetongue.
   Scope and approach: Knowing the driving beliefs can help in selecting an
   appropriate mix of policy instruments to enhance the participation rate
   and thereby improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of voluntary
   vaccination strategies. Results are used to evaluate the policy
   instruments used by the Dutch government in their 2008 vaccination
   strategy (communicative intervention and vaccine subsidization).
   Key findings and conclusions: The paper posits that social interaction
   mechanisms, such as peer group pressure, might advance the design of
   voluntary vaccination strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Small-scale shrimp-culture is an important livelihood for rural
   residents in Thua Thien Hue (TTH) province, central Vietnam. However,
   they are facing the risk of exclusion from the food system due to
   globalization and trade liberalization. To keep these farmers in modern
   supply chains, their relationships with other chain actors, foremost the
   collectors, need to be improved. Thus, this study explores the
   characteristics and constructs of the relationships between the
   small-scale shrimp growers and their collectors. Data was based on a
   survey on 83 small-scale shrimp growers, together with 16 unstructured
   interviews with growers (10) and collectors (6). It was revealed that
   the relationships between small-scale shrimp growers and collectors in
   TTH province are short-term and price-driven and are influenced by the
   power of collectors. The relationship strength was measured by five
   intercorrelated constructs including reliability,
   willingness-to-maintain, desire-fulfilment, negotiation capacity, and
   discussion capacity. Although some constructs were positively
   correlated, the strength of the relationships was weak. Both business
   linkages and social connections affected the grower-collector
   relationships. Female traders had stronger relationships with collectors
   than males. Therefore, interventions should be focused on business and
   social linkages as well as females' involvement in shrimp trade.}},

Abstract = {{Food safety data segmentation and limitations hamper the world's ability
   to select, build up, monitor, and evaluate food safety performance.
   Currently, there is no metric that captures the entire food safety
   system, and performance data are not collected strategically on a global
   scale. Therefore, food safety benchmarking is essential not only to help
   monitor ongoing performance but also to inform continued food safety
   system design, adoption, and implementation toward more efficient and
   effective food safety preparedness, responsiveness, and accountability.
   This comparative study identifies and evaluates common elements among
   global food safety systems. It provides an overall world ranking of food
   safety performance for 17 Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
   Development (OECD) countries, illustrated by 10 indicators organized
   across three food safety risk governance domains: risk assessment
   (chemical risks, microbial risks, and national reporting on food
   consumption), risk management (national food safety capacities, food
   recalls, food traceability, and radionuclides standards), and risk
   communication (allergenic risks, labeling, and public trust). Results
   show all countries have very high food safety standards, but Canada and
   Ireland, followed by France, earned excellent grades relative to their
   peers. However, any subsequent global ranking study should consider the
   development of survey instruments to gather adequate and comparable
   national evidence on food safety.}},

Title = {{Food and nutrition labelling in Thailand: a long march from subsistence
   producers to international traders}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{59-66}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews the evolution of Thai food and nutrition label
   policies and Thailand's international role relating to food product
   safety and standards. The historical record has been interpreted to
   identify future trends and challenges related to food labelling. These
   challenges are arising in Thailand and many similar emerging economies.
   Thailand has a good reputation in world food markets and is now becoming
   a global leader in food production and export. It has become deeply
   involved with regulations and standards applied by World Trade
   Organization and Codex Alimentarius while serving its own population
   with a safe and secure food supply. For consumers considering Thai food
   products, food labels can provide useful nutrition information and help
   build trust.
   Thais began a century ago with policies and laws to enhance food safety
   and to protect Thai consumers. During the lengthy journey from national
   to global standards Thai food labels have evolved and now contribute to
   international food labelling policies. This contribution comes from the
   perspective of a leading middle income south-east Asian food producer
   now trading with high income countries around the world. The story of
   that journey - a case study for many other countries in a similar
   situation - has not previously been told.
   This article provides information for policy makers dealing with food
   labelling, embedding trends and tensions for one middle income food
   exporter in a long history. Information captured here should be helpful
   for other middle income countries, especially those with limited
   records. This strategic knowledge will enable better decisions for
   future policies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Abstract = {{In recent decades, there has been a rapid growth in consumer awareness
   of the influence of corporate activities on the environment, and society
   at large. Finns operating in the food supply chain have not been
   exempted: the vulnerability of agrifood businesses towards public
   opinion incentivizes firms to implement social, environmental and
   ethical measures in collaboration with the other food supply chain
   stakeholders. Previous studies in the food sector have shown that
   corporate social responsibility has positive effects on firm
   performance, but what is still unclear is whether and how much,
   consumers are willing to pay for such an intangible attribute. In
   tackling this issue, we attempt to offer insights into consumer
   willingness to pay for corporate social responsibility attributes,
   identifying the psychological constructs that are likely to influence
   consumer preferences. Our contingent valuation experiment involving
   Italian consumers shows that individual values behave as effective
   determinants of consumer willingness to pay for corporate social
   responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{The steady decline of birds living in cereal steppe lands is a worrying
   situation that the European Common Agricultural Policy is attempting to
   remedy through the application of agri-environmental schemes (AES). We
   assess farmers' preferences towards these AES, which call for a number
   of environmental practices to protect birds. Using a face-to-face survey
   in farming communities in Aragon (Spain), and through the estimation of
   an Ordered Logit model (OL), we assess the ranking of AES attributes,
   and obtain their economic valuation according to the farmers'
   preferences. We find that social factors are also important in
   determining farmers' decisions. In particular, the importance of social
   trust and expectation of compliance by other neighbours, encourage
   farmers to sign up to AES. These and other results may be used to design
   more effective AES and help to solve this important biodiversity
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Food security has long been a concern of Tunisian governments, but these
   concerns have not been addressed successfully using conventional public
   finance instruments. The current crisis in the food economy leads to an
   unsustainable situation, therefore it is imperative to explore
   alternative reforms. These cannot succeed without establishing
   appropriate contractual relations, which in turn depend on proper
   procedures for negotiations among the various parties involved in the
   food system.
   The current transition in Tunisia has resulted in a relative weakening
   of the State, which has resulted in relatively weak regulation of the
   food agro-system. One of the unfortunate results is a lack of trust in
   the negotiations between the various parties, for example when
   agribusinesses change the prices they charge for products without the
   approval of the State and without renegotiating contracts with the
   farmers. This tendency to anarchy in a field where the presence of trust
   is to the benefit of all parties is counterproductive.
   In this regard, the regulation of the sector is anything but simple. The
   problem is the lack of effective co-operation between the two main
   parties, the agribusinesses and the farmers. There is a dysfunction that
   prevents the agro-food system from profiting from satisfactory
   co-operation, which is why collaboration based on adequate contracts is
   recommended.
   There is a particular logic to the negotiation of co-operation contracts
   between farmers and service suppliers and processors in the agro-food
   complex. Because of asymmetrical information between the two partners, a
   high degree of trust is required as the basis for respecting commitments
   concerning the regularity of supply in terms of both quality and
   quantity, and reciprocally in terms of the processing capacity and the
   reliability of financial commitments. In this regard, it is important to
   observe that, in most cases, the exchange between the agribusiness and
   the farmer is characteristic of a monopsony market, where the former has
   market power. Collective action in the form of producers' unions and
   co-operatives therefore is desirable in order to balance this market
   power.
   Within this framework, the purpose of this article is to try to identify
   empirically the point at which collective action by farmers leads to
   better performance compared to individual action. To this end, a survey
   was conducted during 2010 among dairy farmers in three regions of
   Tunisia, namely Mahdia, Zaghouan and Sidi Bouzid, in order to measure
   the impact of supervision by the cooperatives on the price and quality
   performance of the dairy products. The results show how important
   collective action among producers is to improve their negotiating power
   in the supply of feed and veterinary products, which make up 80\% of
   their costs. Producers who adhere to agricultural service co-operatives
   satisfy the quality standards far better than farmers operating
   individually. Similarly, profitability per litre in areas with high
   levels of co-operation is roughly double average profitability.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a model of relational governance as a hybrid form of

   regression modeling is employed to test the model on data collected from
   a sample of 170 Albanian farmers engaged in the cultivation and
   collection of medicinal aromatic plants. The results show that asset
   specificity and antecedents of trust are the strongest predictors of
   relational governance, and competition among suppliers has small but
   significant positive effect. Directions for further research on
   determinants of this particular governance choice are also developed in
   the light of the research limitations.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides insights on urban Russian consumers' attitudes and
   perceptions toward organic food, as well as factors that facilitate or
   prevent them from purchasing these products. We adopted an exploratory
   mixed-method approach, using a combination of qualitative and
   quantitative investigations undertaken in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Our
   results suggest that organic food consumption is mainly motivated by
   personal well-being and less by social or environmental concerns. Most
   participants perceive organic food as higher quality products, based
   upon which they show an acceptance of a price premium for organic food.
   The group of organic food consumers in our study relies on organic
   agriculture as one possible strategy to cope with food safety problems.
   The presence of strict standards for organic food, the trustworthiness
   of foreign certifications and the perceived higher quality of foreign
   products (especially from Europe) are perceived together as a safety
   guarantee. Our results further indicate that the widespread confusion
   regarding product recognition represents an important obstacle for
   organic food consumption growth. Implementing a coherent legislative
   framework to allow product labeling is apparently crucial yet not
   sufficient for developing the organic sector in Russia; moreover, trust
   in food labeling and control systems as well as awareness about organic
   standards is also required.}},

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{37-47}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Due to the ongoing changes from traditional open markets to Western
   style supermarkets in China, Chinese consumers have the opportunity to
   base their decisions increasingly on extrinsic quality cues like brand,
   safety certification and origin, in addition to the traditional
   intrinsic quality cues like color and fat. This study investigates
   choice of fresh pork by Chinese consumers employing a pairwise choice
   methodology. Latent class analysis shows that for the majority of
   consumers intrinsic cues are still dominating the choice, and only for a
   small segment did information on brand, origin and quality certification
   have a major role. Also, there was a segment of consumers that did seem
   to make random choices. The results indicate that Chinese consumers are
   still in a transitory phase, where they are building up competencies in
   handling product information while the sector struggles to build
   credibility and trust. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is a common finding that men compared to women are less concerned
   about food hazards and technologies. While previous literature analyzed
   determinants such as trust in public actors in order to explain gender
   differences in food risk perception, a systematic analysis of women's
   and men's cognitions (associations) and emotions (feelings) is lacking.
   This study focuses on the very first associations and the deeper motives
   and values that women and men link to three potential food hazards:
   mycotoxins, pesticides and irradiation. Means-end chain theory was
   applied and in-depth laddering interviews were conducted with 34 women
   and 35 men in Munich, Germany. The results reveal that food hazards
   threaten self-centered and socio-altruistic values of men and women
   alike and that `care for others' is not only a motive for women. (C)

Abstract = {{The traceability practices and systems of 48 separate seafood businesses
   were assessed as part of an evaluation of 9 global seafood value chains
   (from catch to point of sale to the consumer). The purpose was to gain
   insights and provide knowledge about the impact of traceability on
   improving seafood industry business performance, including reducing
   waste, and enhancing consumer trust. In addition, the project developed
   and delivered a tool that can be used by stakeholders that are seeking
   to better understand the return on investment of implementation of
   traceability practices and solutions. Using structured and
   semistructured interviews of over 80 individuals, the research revealed
   that traceability is more highly valued by businesses, regardless of
   their size, if they engage more often in highly collaborative activities
   with their suppliers and customers. A survey in 5 nations about consumer
   perceptions with regards to seafood and the key factors influencing
   their purchasing decisions delivered insights into the discrete choices
   that consumers make when buying seafood products. The consumer survey
   data were incorporated into a Discrete Choice Simulator that others can
   use to compare and contrast the preferences of consumers in these
   countries and better understand what factors regarding traceability
   impact on their buying decisions. The research concluded with several

Abstract = {{We analyze the role of trust in the evaluation of a new food technology,
   namely nanotechnology. A literature review in the social and economic
   sciences reveals that many different trust concepts are available. The
   economics literature suggests that trust can lead to lower efforts of
   self-protecting behavior. Translating this concept into the framework of
   willingness to pay (WTP) for food products allows for the derivation of
   hypotheses on the workings of trust. We show that WTP for new food
   characteristics increases with trust also when new information about the
   technology is revealed. The results are confirmed with online survey
   data for Canada and Germany and experimental data in Germany. (C) 2014

Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},

Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{92-98}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We examine determinants of consumers' choices of functional canola oil
   products that may contain genetically modified (GM) ingredients, with
   emphasis on the influences of trust and health control beliefs. We find
   that both generalized trust and trust in the food system tend to offset
   negative perceptions associated with the GM food and that respondents
   who believe in internal control over health are more likely to purchase
   functional food. Our results also show that joint inclusion of both
   personality traits (trust and control) provides a clearer interpretation
   of their impact on preferences. The disutility associated with GM food
   ingredients outweighs the value that respondents place on enhanced
   omega-3 content in a canola oil product, suggesting that commercial
   marketing of canola oil products using genetic modification to enhance
   levels of omega-3 content may be challenging. Policy implications are
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Consumer confidence in credence attributes: The role of brand trust}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{99-107}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{While the concept of institutional trust has received considerable
   attention in different branches of the social science literature, brand
   trust has been somewhat neglected, particularly with respect to the food
   sector. Motivated by the need to further investigate the concept, this
   paper develops a conceptual framework that explores the effects of brand
   trust, trust in the food system, consumer confidence and brand loyalty.
   While most extant studies have examined the brand trust-brand loyalty
   link, this paper proposes that: (i) the impact of brand trust on
   consumer confidence in brand attributes is mediated by trust in the food
   system, and (ii) brand trust leads to brand loyalty via consumer
   confidence. The proposition is tested using Structural Equation
   Modelling techniques based on survey data from a sample of Canadian
   consumers of packaged green salad. Results indicate that in a food
   context, brand trust is positively associated with consumer confidence
   in brand quality and safety, largely via trust in the food system.
   Furthermore, confidence in credence attributes is shown to lead to brand
   loyalty. While previous research conceived brand trust as a
   multidimensional construct, the analysis suggests that trust in food
   brands could be better explained by a one-factor model. (C) 2014

   of consumers' trust}},
Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{108-114}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cause related marketing (CrM) has become one of the most dynamic
   marketing tools. CrM allows companies to signal their overall business
   culture regarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at the point of
   sale. More recently retail chains in Germany have started to use CrM as
   a strategy to differentiate themselves and their products and to secure
   customer loyalty in highly competitive markets. For consumers the
   information necessary to assess the fairness of the terms of a CrM
   campaign is in general not available. Thus, trust becomes an important
   issue. The aim of our study is to understand the role of trust for the
   success of a CrM campaign. We consider consumers' trust in a retailer's
   CrM campaign for the success of a specific campaign as well as the role
   of consumers' general trust in CrM and thus of potential spillover
   effects. The empirical study is based on a standardised online consumer
   survey carried out in Germany. Our hypotheses are tested using
   structural equation modelling (SEM). The results reveal that consumers'
   trust in a retailer's CrM campaign increases consumer's loyalty in the
   retailer. We, in addition, show that general trust in CrM campaigns, a
   factor external to the influence of the retailer, has a significant
   influence on trust in a specific campaign. Based on our results we
   derive market and policy recommendations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION PRESENTATION FORMATS ON CONSUMER
   ACCEPTABILITY: THE CASE OF GOAT MILK PRESENTED AS OBTAINED FROM
   DIFFERENT REARING SYSTEMS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The present study aimed to evaluate whether information about the main
   aspects related to milk production practices adopted in the two major
   systems of small ruminant farming (i.e., intensive and semi-extensive
   rearing systems) can affect consumer acceptability of two different
   types of goat milk: semi-skimmed and whole milk. Four milk-information
   combinations were evaluated in two experiments, which differed for the
   information presentation formats (i.e., textual description versus video
   with narration). Information about semi-extensive rearing system had a
   high positive effect on milk liking, especially in video-with-narration
   condition. Moreover, this information presentation format generated
   higher hedonic expectations for milk presented as obtained from
   intensive rearing system than did textual description only. We conclude
   that information about some farming practices related to milk production
   may be important for helping consumers to make informed food choices,
   especially when conveying it by a video-with-narration format.
   Practical ApplicationsThe disclosure of information about livestock
   production practices is important for shortening the distance between
   those who produce food and their consumers. Illustrating such
   information may help consumers to understand how food is produced and,
   hence, to build their trust in food production. Our results show that
   video with narration seems to be an effective presentation format for
   conveying such information. In a purchase situation, this may be
   achieved via the Internet, for instance, by voluntarily printing a
   matrix barcode on a food label. When scanned by a smartphone, the
   barcode can direct the smartphone to display a video, text or other
   information, which may help consumers to make more informed food
   choices. The adoption of this strategy may contribute to differentiate
   animal products from farms aimed at boosting their transparency in the
   global market of food.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{304-312}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Food consumers became more concerned about radioactive contamination of
   food after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011; thus, the present
   study aimed to survey food consumers to obtain their views on risk
   perception, general knowledge, confidence in existing information
   sources, and the information required to develop strategic risk
   communication plans. In total, we surveyed 1208 food consumers in the
   Republic of Korea, who were selected randomly for a multi-stage
   stratified systematic sampling process with a computer-aided telephone
   interview based on random digit dialing. A high number of consumers
   (77.2\%) actually avoided purchasing Japanese foods because they
   perceived that there was a potential radiological risk. The consumers'
   levels of knowledge about radioactivity, environmental radiation, and
   health effects were relatively low, particularly the safe dosage limits
   for radiation and natural radioactive decay (recognition rate < 30.0\%).
   A number of the respondents (56.1\%) were seldom or never confident in
   the government's handling of food safety following the accident. Among
   the existing information sources, mass media (36.9\%) were considered to
   be the most credible, followed by consumer organizations (26.6\%),
   governmental institutions (12.5\%), and food safety experts (7.7\%). The
   subjects required a variety of information on food safety issues related
   to radioactive contaminations, but their actual search behaviors were
   highly passive. In relation to the socio-demographic characteristics,
   women and consumers with high involvement in food purchasing tended to
   be more sensitive about the potential risks for food produced in those
   areas affected by the nuclear accident. In relation to general
   knowledge, women, the elderly, and those with low educational attainment
   tended to have low awareness of radioactivity, environmental radiation,
   and the health effects of radiation exposure. These results provide a
   valuable resource for understanding consumers' general opinions about
   food safety issues following the Fukushima nuclear accident. In
   addition, they may facilitate the production of meaningful
   recommendations regarding appropriate risk communications and the
   education of consumers about the radiological safety of foods in the
   context of a potential nuclear emergency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Active membership is crucial for agricultural cooperatives as it
   engenders better performance. It even is the key for cooperative
   competitiveness. Active membership, however, decreases in many
   cooperatives. Thus, it is important to know what galvanizes members to
   become active members. The cooperative's value and the cooperative's
   offers motivate some members to become active members, but certainly not
   all of them. Therefore, more work needs to be done to understand the
   social attributes that transform members into active members. In this
   paper the incentives that sustain members' participation over time and
   the contribution of members' active participation in the cooperative's
   competitive advantage are studied. Empirical evidence is provided via a
   questionnaire completed by 241 cooperative members of a Dutch feed
   supply cooperative and interviews with cooperative experts. Results show
   that active membership builds on social attributes, such as cooperative
   culture, open communication, trust, involvement, and the willingness to
   be active. It is explained that these social attributes create benefits
   for both the cooperative and its members. Finally, suggestions are
   presented to stimulate active cooperative membership.}},

   from the local market and from national and international super-market
   chains and included dairy products and industrially processed packaged
   food from meat, poultry and fish. All products were grouped in seven
   groups: milk, food for pets, packaged yellow cheeses, packaged white
   cheeses, PDO cheeses, processed meats and frozen fish foodstuff.
   Mislabelled foods were found in all seven groups but the extent of
   adulteration differed between groups. The lowest percentage (15\%) was
   found for packaged yellow cheeses whilst the highest (54\%) for foods
   for pets. Mislabelling for milks was 26\%, for packaged white cheeses
   29\%, for PDO cheeses 26\%, for frozen fish products 35\% and for
   processed meats 34\%. These alarming findings, combined with those
   retrieved from the literature, raise significant concern in the
   monitoring methods employed for supervision worldwide. It is urgent for
   the authorities to address the adequacy of labelling, to improve and
   extent monitoring methods and redefine penalising policies against food
   fraud. On the other hand, the food industry should assume its
   responsibilities and establish its own accurate and extensive control
   and inspection mechanisms. Otherwise, there is a growing risk of losing
   the trust of consumers as well as a large percentage of profits. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of items' physical position in the
   best-worst scaling technique. Although the best-worst scaling technique
   has been widely used in many fields, the literature has largely
   overlooked the phenomenon of consumers' adoption of processing
   strategies while making their best-worst choices. We examine this issue
   in the context of consumers' trust in institutions to provide
   information about a new food technology, nanotechnology, and its use in
   food processing. Our results show that approximately half of the
   consumers used position as a schematic cue when making choices. We find
   the position bias was particularly strong when consumers chose their
   most trustworthy institution compared to their least trustworthy
   institution. In light of our findings, we recommend that researchers in
   the field be aware of the possibility of position bias when designing
   best-worst scaling surveys. We also encourage researchers who have
   already collected best-worst data to investigate whether their data
   shows such heuristics.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of new generation agricultural products has generated
   an increased need for efficient and accurate product segregation across
   a number of Canadian agricultural sectors. As a key component of wheat
   handling in the Canadian grain industry, grading of wheat for
   value-added blending has historically been accomplished by visual
   identification. As of 2008 in Canada, visual identification was
   eliminated for all primary classes of wheat and replaced by an
   alternative system of wheat declaration. Given the high costs of testing
   each truck and railcar for quality assurance, the declaration system
   must rely on incentives and trust as there is now considerable potential
   for accidental or opportunistic misrepresentation throughout the grain
   supply chain. This research attempts to identify cost-effective handling
   strategies and policies so as to maintain the integrity of the supply
   chain under the new declaration system. An agent-based simulation model
   is developed to capture the effects of individual heterogeneity as well
   as behavioral adaption to the declaration system within the modern wheat
   supply chain. The simulated results are used to identify superior
   testing strategies for handlers, along with the relative risks and costs
   associated with each of the testing strategies.

   l'identification visuelle des principales classes de ble a ete abolie en
   2008 et a ete remplacee par un systeme de declaration de la classe de

Abstract = {{Food traceability standards aim to reduce the risk of food-borne disease
   by facilitating the withdrawal of food and feed products and to provide
   consumers with targeted information. This paper analyses consumers'
   attitude and behaviour towards traceable food in two different European
   countries: Italy and France. A survey has been conducted on two samples
   of Italian (n = 503) and French (n = 501) consumers, aiming to explain
   the intention toward purchasing traceable food using the theory of
   planned behaviour (TPB). The predictive power of the TPB model
   significantly increases in both countries when new variables are added:
   habits, trust, past behaviour and socio-demographics. The results show
   that attitudes drive the intention to purchase traceable chicken and
   honey in France. Trust affects the intention to purchase traceable
   chicken and honey in Italy. These findings may serve to target public
   interventions and private strategies towards food traceability. (C) 2013

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{24-30}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The assumption that consumers prefer cosmetically perfect fruits and
   vegetables contributes to global food waste, because food retailers
   refuse to offer abnormally shaped food. This study empirically examines
   how food shape abnormality affects purchase intentions and how two
   individual difference variables, environmental concern and social trust,
   might moderate the food shape abnormality-purchase intention
   relationship for consumers in China. A representative sample of 212
   Chinese consumers indicated their purchase intentions for two fruits and
   two vegetables with varying levels of food shape abnormality (normal,
   moderately abnormal, and extremely abnormal). The results demonstrate
   that food shape influences purchase intentions; consumers are more
   likely to purchase normally shaped fruits and vegetables than moderately
   or extremely abnormally shaped food. However, environmental concern and
   social trust also drive purchase intentions, such that participants with
   high levels of environmental concern express higher purchase intentions
   toward abnormally shaped food. Social trust alone is not sufficient to
   prompt the purchase of abnormal food, but consumers with high social
   trust and high environmental concern are more likely to purchase. Thus,
   increasing environmental concern, particularly among consumers with low
   social trust, might encourage more people to purchase abnormally shaped
   fruits and vegetables. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},

Pages = {{16-23}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{High Pressure Processing (HPP) and Pulsed-Electric Field (PEF) are
   non-thermal technologies that add value to foods by improving safety
   through lowering microbial loads in addition to improving the sensory
   properties such as color, flavor, and texture. While Heat Treatment (HT)
   is more widely accepted by consumers, it is a more destructive process
   compared to HPP and PEF. Little is known about how Chinese consumers
   perceive non-thermal technologies like HPP and PEF. This research aimed
   to understand Chinese consumer's perceptions of non-thermal processing
   technologies and ways to mitigate negative perceptions. Specifically,
   this research sought to investigate: (a) consumers' general knowledge of
   food processing technologies; (b) the effect of information on
   consumers' perceptions of HT, HPP and PEF and how these perceptions
   influence decisions for their treated beverages; and (c) consumers'
   willingness to pay for products processed using these technologies.
   Six focus groups were conducted in Hangzhou, China. When participants
   were provided limited and detailed technology information, six dominant
   consumer perceptions towards HT, HPP, and PEF emerged. Those perceptions
   were: (1) consumer association with the given technology, (2) trust
   towards the technology, (3) health, (4) food, (5) taste and quality, and
   (6) price. When limited information was provided, consumers were
   skeptical of HPP and PEF. However, the provision of detailed technology
   information changed participants' attitudes towards HPP and PEF
   technologies and increased their stated purchase intentions for the
   treated products. Participants were also found to place less emphasis on
   the price for HPP and PEP treated beverages when detailed technology
   information was provided. Chinese consumers were interested in having
   fewer additives in their foods. Non-thermally processed foods offer this
   benefit.
   Given the change in attitudes after receiving detailed information, HPP
   and PEF processing technologies have potential to be widely accepted by
   Chinese consumers. However, to effectively promote these technologies,
   consumer education is needed to increase awareness of the advantages
   these technologies have for foods. Practical communication strategies
   are provided to help food manufacturers inform Chinese consumers about
   the benefits of these technologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study aims to highlight the importance of the consulting
   activity in identifying and defining the specific problems of the
   population in agriculture, solving alternatives, choice of solutions and
   their implementation. Based on these considerations, we initiated a
   study in Classio county, on a sample of 32 communes both among the rural
   population, having as technique of data collection,, door to door{''}
   discussions and among the leaders of the rural communities using
   interview technique. The interview on both levels was conducted based on
   a list of predetermined questions, 8 questions for the population and 12
   questions for the leaders, with open response, which allowed freedom of
   expression of the interviewed person. The questions aimed at identifying
   the needs that respondents consider priority for the community, how they
   want to solve them, and the degree to which they consider that they
   might involve in solving the local problems. A fiche with personal data
   was filled in for each interviewed person.
   Processing and analyzing the data, outlines the need for the consultant
   intervention of socio- economic targeting, which is a real challenge in
   persuading and train the population in the rural area, involved or not
   in the agricultural activity, in order to develop the skills and incomes
   for goods administration, in order to adapt to the challenges imposed by
   the agricultural production, household, family and socio- economic
   relations. The success of the socio - economic consulting activity is
   knowing the area were the consulting services are provided, but also the
   consultant notoriety among them, because people follow those they trust

Abstract = {{All producers must apply HACCP and they should have mutual trust. In
   individual HACCP shouldn't be any gaps in hazard control; likewise,
   there shouldn't be gaps between neighboring producers. However, gaps do
   exist, mostly due to lack of motivation. After initial HACCP
   establishing the motivation drops and the system(s) may deteriorate to a
   GMP level. It's vital to monitor status of HACCP(s) implementation and
   motivation level(s) on local and national level(s) to analyze changes
   and draw conclusions about their impact on the food safety management
   system at the national level, thus providing feedback for the national
   food protection system. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The New Zealand Sustainability Dashboard (NZSD) is an on-line assessment
   and reporting tool to guide sustainable production of wine and
   kiwifruit. It uses internationally recognised frameworks and locally
   grounded key performance indicators (KPIs) to simultaneously enable
   learning for sustainability, meet compliance requirements and verify
   environmental, social, production and business performance. Most KPIs
   are regularly scored and uploaded by the growers and viticulturists so
   that participation is inexpensive, rapid and does not require specialist
   knowledge. Some secondary or aggregate KPIs will be automatically
   calculated by accessing national and regional databases and maps (e.g.
   weather and soil maps) or models (e.g. a carbon footprint calculator).
   The grower's KPIs are instantly benchmarked against neighbours'
   performance and matched enterprises to incentivise improvement, and
   compared against their own previous scores for trend analysis. KPIs will
   be scaled against amber and red alert thresholds to flag when
   intervention is required. `What-if' decision modules will be linked to
   the KPIs so that the growers can optimise investments to improve
   performance. Survey modules will allow the network of growers to guide
   industry strategy. Key challenges and opportunities encountered when
   designing and testing the prototype New Zealand Sustainability
   Dashboards are balancing generalisability and specificity, scientific
   reliability, cross-scale linkage and participation by growers. The
   Sustainability Dashboard needs to be trusted by multiple stakeholders if
   it is to secure food integrity, food safety, environmental stewardship
   and future-proof market access by verifying market assurance claims.}},

   related to fresh fruit and vegetables. This case study analyzes the 2011
   E. coli outbreak in Germany, which was attributed to contaminated
   organic fenugreek sprouts which caused 53 fatalities. Horticulture
   producers in several European countries suffered economic losses
   amounting to over 800 million within the first two weeks of the
   outbreak. In the wake of the outbreak, the European Union allocated 227
   million in compensation to producers in 22 member states. The focus of
   this study is on three factors shaping crisis management during a risk
   event: timely communication; acknowledgment of risk; and control of
   stigma. Outbreak-related media reports by a national newspaper and an
   industry-oriented on-line portal, as well as official advisory notices
   and press releases are compared using qualitative content analysis. When
   comparing information provided by government authorities and the media,
   the relationship is unclear. The analysis shows premature proclamations
   by the authorities, but German consumers continued to trust the
   government as they followed the recommendations provided.}},

   a systematic review of literature and a case study methodology to

   the impact of responsibility in supply chain relationships. The
   conceptual framework was validated by examining four case studies of

Title = {{The Public Debate on Biofuels in Germany: Who Drives the Discourse?}},
Journal = {{GERMAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{263-273}},
Abstract = {{Following the European Commission's concept of a ``Knowledge-based
   Bioeconomy{''} (KBBE), great significance in the process of political
   decision-making shall be attached to scientific expertise. In contrast,
   the conducted print media analysis on the German biofuel discourse for
   the period from 1995 to 2012 only found a marginal role of scientific
   actors in the debate. Even though support for biofuels has been largely
   rejected as inefficient by several scientific brain trusts for many
   years, the German government, as well as the EU adhere to this policy.
   This raises the question of the underlying interests that drive the
   persistent support for biofuels. In this context, the paper investigates
   the standing and positioning of different actors in the public media and
   thereby it contributes to a better understanding of why the political
   support for biofuels is continued, despite the doubts of scientists. One
   of the core findings of the study states, that one reason for this
   political support can be seen in the dominance of a coalition of biofuel
   advocates, mainly formed by political and economic actors, in the public
   discourse.}},

Title = {{Governance implications of non-GM private standards on poultry meat
   value chains}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{10, SI}},
Pages = {{2564-2581}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the governance
   implications of non-genetically modified (GM) voluntary private
   standards on the private label poultry meat value chain of the leading
   Italian retailer. Considered aspects are: first, the organizational
   practices adopted along the chain to assure effective segregation;
   second, the changes in the characteristics and governance of the key
   transaction (meat processor-retailer); finally, what makes the chain
   economically sustainable.
   Design/methodology/approach - A picture of the chain is obtained
   collecting information from the businesses involved; the snowball
   selection criterion is used in identifying people to interview.
   Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) is used to conceptualize the
   organizational changes in the meat processor-retailer transaction; the
   coherence of expected-actual variations in asset specificity,
   uncertainty and frequency, as well as of the observed governance with
   TCE predictions is assessed.
   Findings - The creation of the non-GM chain required investments by both
   the key actors involved and the establishment of a partnership based on
   trust and mutual dependence. The increase in uncertainty coupled with
   the rise in asset specificity led to higher transaction costs, requiring
   a shift of the governance structure toward the right side of the
   market-hierarchy continuum to economize on costs and improve supply
   chain performance. TCE well explains the changes occurred. The retailer
   values the return on image as a strategic asset and bears the non-GM
   extra costs making the chain economically sustainable.
   Research limitations/implications - The implications of the findings are
   twofold. First, they help to identify the critical factors for an
   effective and economically sustainable segregation of non-GM
   products/raw materials along agro-food value chains. Second, they show
   how chain actors could adopt tighter governance structures in order to
   comply with binding technical and quality specifications, economize on
   transaction costs and improve supply chain performance.
   Originality/value - Retailer-led private standards used as regulation
   and enforcement mechanisms in vertical relations, as well as their
   organizational implications in the governance of transactions between
   actors in agro-food value chains have received insufficient attention.
   This research contributes to fill out this gap.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{10, SI}},
Pages = {{2582-2597}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that
   models farmers' strategic decision making, taking into account that
   farmers adapt to institutional changes, given the social structure in
   which they are embedded.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, a theoretical framework was
   developed using the reasoned action approach, innovation diffusion
   research, identity research, and the theory of structuration. Second,
   the framework was refined based on insights gained through
   semi-structured interviews with seven pork farmers and six pork farming
   experts on innovation decisions in general and added-value market
   adoption in particular.
   Findings - The farmer decision-making framework distinguishes personal
   characteristics, social influence related to reference groups, and the
   institutional context that determines the space for manoeuvre. The
   interviews reveal the importance of context specific factors, such as
   trust in policy and market requirements, and point at general mechanisms
   of path dependency as a result of previous decision making and social
   influence related to identity reference groups.
   Originality/value - The authors include feedback mechanisms between on
   the one hand social structure and institutional context, and on the
   other, farmer decision making. The framework is designed to explore the
   combined influence of factors of decision making on sector behaviour and
   study the relation between individual and collective behaviour.}},

   Design/methodology/approach - A new emotional model in which cognitive
   factors influence emotional factors from the bottom-up was made and the
   validity of the model was tested. A social survey was conducted in
   Tokyo, Japan, among 120 female undergraduate students.
   Findings - The results showed that the new emotional model had a higher
   validity than the conventional emotional model, in which emotional
   factors influence cognitive factors.
   Research limitations/implications - The reliability and validity of the
   present models should be reconfirmed with a sample of more than 200
   subjects in the future. The sample comprised only Japanese female
   undergraduate students and additional studies be conducted with diverse
   samples to ensure that the proposed model is valid and reliable across
   multiple settings. Future studies should verify whether the use of other
   topics would produce the same results.
   Practical implications - As it is often difficult to directly affect
   consumer's emotions by providing information and education for only a
   short period of time, it may be advisable to try to change consumer's
   cognitions about the perceived risks and benefits through information
   and education instead.
   Social implications - The greater significance of the current study is
   the suggestion that the influence of perceptions on emotions should also
   be considered when evaluating consumer's acceptance.
   Originality/value - This study showed that the influence of cognitive
   factors, such as perceived risk and perceived benefit, is also effective
   in an emotional model. This importantly suggests that consumer's
   emotions like anxiety and anger can be changed by altering consumer's
   cognitions or perceptions.}},

Title = {{A multi-stakeholder perspective on the adoption of good agricultural
   practices in the Thai fresh produce industry}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2234-2249}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors hindering
   the adoption of good agricultural practices (GAPs) in the Thai fresh
   fruit and vegetable industry from the perspectives of key stakeholders
   in different tiers of the supply chain up to consumers.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were carried
   out in Bangkok and nearby cities. The key informants were experts,
   governmental authorities, producers, distributors, exporters, and
   consumers. A qualitative content-summarising approach was used to
   analyse the interview transcripts.
   Findings - Stakeholders perceived the credibility of national GAP
   (Q-GAP) standards implemented in the Thai domestic market as low, due to
   a lack of reliable verification and traceability and because the system
   is managed by governmental bodies. Consumer demand could drive the
   market of safe produce, but retail stores are the main influencers of
   producers' adoption of GAPs in domestic markets.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a small
   group of Thai fresh produce industry players and consumers who operate
   mainly in an urban context.
   Practical implications - The paper provides relevant information for
   policy makers and industrialists to find appropriate strategies to
   sustain GAPs in Thailand. Stakeholder awareness of food safety issues
   and information provision are crucial.
   Originality/value - This is the first in-depth study of stakeholders'
   perceptions of GAP implementation in the Thai fresh produce supply chain
   as the industry is currently transitioning from a commodity market to a
   quality/safety-oriented market. The results raise important issues
   regarding GAP adoption, food safety certification, and labelling in
   Thailand.}},

Abstract = {{Food safety and quality certificates can be viewed as credence
   characteristics because different actors (e.g. intermediaries,
   processors, retailers, consumers) in the food supply chain are not able
   to observe the quality of the audits in situ. This becomes more critical
   in the international food trade as information asymmetries increase with
   time and distance and the credibility of the standard behind the
   certificate may decrease as a consequence. In this context, the aim of
   this study was to assess from a global perspective the effect of country
   image on the perceived credibility of food standards. Data were
   collected through an on-line survey during Spring 2010. In total,
   responses provided by 301 practitioners from developed and developing
   countries were analysed. Respondents were asked to evaluate the
   credibility of food standards from eight countries (Ghana, Italy,
   Australia, Mexico, China, UK, India and USA). Data were analysed using
   descriptive statistics, independent-samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U
   tests. Principal component analysis was used to categorise groups of
   standards according to their perceived credibility. The findings reveal
   that country image exerts a significant influence on practitioners'
   credibility assessments of food standards. Standards from the UK were
   perceived as the most credible whereas standards from China were
   perceived as the least credible. Based on the results of this study, we
   discuss some implications for food suppliers and policy makers.}},

Abstract = {{Citrus is an economically important world tree fruit crop with
   production in more than 146 countries. The center of origin for citrus
   is considered to be Southeastern Asia including southern China,
   northeastern India, and Malaysia, with secondary centers in surrounding
   areas. Novel and commercially significant scion and rootstock cultivars
   originating by natural mutation or directed hybridization were
   introduced during the past century. Significant genetic resource
   collections exist in many countries. A global citrus germplasm network
   was developed in 1997. Now that the International Treaty on Plant
   Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGR) has recognized Citrus
   as an Annex 1 crop, a global conservation strategy needs to be
   established. The objective of this workshop was to plan the development
   of this strategy. More than 60 delegates attended with representation
   from Argentina, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Columbia, France,
   Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Turkey,
   UAE, US, and Vietnam. Nine oral presentations were given describing
   multiple aspects of genebank operations, technologies and gaps in
   Brazil, China, France, Australia, Spain, and the US. A draft genebank
   survey questionnaire was presented to the group and comments and
   suggested changes for improvement were received. Citrus curators and
   genebank managers throughout the world will be surveyed for the status
   and health of their collections. The surveys will be received and
   compiled by collaborators at the University of California, Riverside,
   and at the USDA ARS Riverside. This information will be compiled and
   reported. The strategy will include background and history of the
   development of Citrus as a cultivated crop, conservation protocols,
   vulnerabilities, and recommendations for safeguarding Citrus germplasm.
   This strategy will be implemented through the Global Crop Diversity
   Trust with collaboration from the International Society for
   Horticultural Science and the international Citrus research community.}},

   light of rising sustainability concerns}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1474-1487}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an exploratory study
   of how Taiwanese consumer concerns about sustainability issues relating
   to pork are linked to their purchasing behaviours, using the case of
   ``warm{''} meat.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on qualitative
   semi-structured interviews of a cluster random sample of meat-purchasing
   consumers in Taiwan. The study data are analysed in light of grounded
   theory, to provide a clearer understanding of interviewees'
   sustainability concerns arising from meat consumption.
   Findings - Results indicate that consumers do make meat-purchasing
   decisions based on to their sustainability concerns, and that there are
   a wide variety of such concerns, which can be broadly categorised as
   food security, animal welfare, and the environment. These implicate a
   variety of factors including ways of selling (e.g. fresh or frozen), the
   provision of information about production methods, certification, and
   traceability. By comparing consumers in supermarkets and traditional
   markets, the paper identifies divergent perspectives on food security in
   the context of local dining culture, and concludes that trust is a
   significant factor influencing purchasing behaviour.
   Originality/value - Prior research about consumers' meat-purchasing
   habits and sustainability concerns is limited and de-contextualised. The
   present findings have implications for future communications to
   consumers, in that greater emphasis should be given to the local
   cultural contexts of food. It will be valuable to academics, livestock
   producers, consumer organisations, and policymakers interested in
   enhancing communication and trust between and among producers,
   consumers, retailers and government agencies.}},

Abstract = {{This research examines how relationship quality affects the intention of
   past consumers to spread positive electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) in

   to positive e-WOM. Exploration the influence of customer psychographic
   aspect toward the e-WOM was measured on the expenses basis of the buyer.
   The results show an evidence of positive effect of customer satisfaction
   to customer trust and commitment. Further, positive e-WOM is not
   promoted by the satisfaction level as experienced by customers before it
   is converted into commitment. There is a moderating effect of customer
   expense tendency to positive e-WOM as well. (C) 2015 Published by

Title = {{How differing demographic factors impact consumers' loyalty towards
   national or international fast food chains A comparative study in
   emerging markets}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1354-1376}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study differing demographic
   factors affecting fast-food customers loyalty towards national or
   international fast food chains. It also compares the variation between
   global and local fast food chains as the products offered are culturally
   different.
   Design/methodology/approach - A variety of variables used to gain a
   holistic view, which includes factors such as quality, price, food and
   demographic profile of consumers affecting loyalty of fast food chains.
   The study adopts the theory and method of the trust-commitment-loyalty
   explanation chain and examines the consumer survey adapted from Fast
   food by Sahagun et al. (2014). The present analyses 542 filled
   questionnaires in which systematic sampling is used. Systematic sampling
   procedure is adopted.
   Findings - Indians prefer global fast food chains compared to Indian
   fast food chains. Loyalty towards global brands is higher than that for
   Indian brands because they are found to be of better quality which leads
   to higher frequency of visit and recommendation of the brands to their
   friends and colleagues. There are ethnic variations towards global and
   Indian fast food chains. Global brand of food chains generated more good
   word of mouth publicity compared to Indian food chains. Demographic
   factors play a role in the patronage of fast food chains.
   Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of this
   research is the study adapts the theory and method of the
   trust-commitment-loyalty explanation chain and examines the consumer
   survey adapted from a study of Sahagun et al. (2014) on fast food for
   emerging markets. Only India is studied, but the addition of other
   countries like Brazil, China, Russia and South Africa can add value.
   Practical implications - Fast food managers had to illustrate the
   satisfaction on affective response, such as quality of food, convenient
   location, variety, service and value for money. Demographic variables
   like gender, age, education, income and ethnicity, global and local
   Brand will affect the perceptions.
   Originality/value - This is the first attempt to study the loyalty of
   consumers in emerging markets, which is witnessing the entry of many
   fast food global chains. It studies the demographic variables effect on
   the loyalty and the behaviour of consumers and compares to local and
   global brand fast food chains. The research will be use to global
   managers who are planning to expand in emerging markets like India.}},

Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1552-1560}},
Abstract = {{European regulations mandate that only substantiated and approved
   statements can be used as nutrition- and health-related claims in food
   marketing. A thorough understanding of consumer perceptions of these
   approved claims is needed to assess their impact on both the purchase
   intention of functional foods and the development of innovative
   functional food concepts. In this paper, a conceptual framework on the
   European consumers' perception of nutrition and health claims on these
   functional foods is proposed. Through a literature review, common
   independent variables are structured, and an analysis of these variables
   shows that nutrition and health claims are mostly only perceived
   positive by specific target consumers (who need the product, accept the
   ingredient, understand the benefit, and trust the brand). These
   consumers indicate that the products with substantiated and approved
   claims help them in reaching overall health goals. This increased
   expectation in functional efficacy may mediate an increase in repurchase
   intent, overall liking, and the amount consumers are willing to spend.
   Other consumers, however, may have adverse reactions towards nutrition
   and health claims on functional foods. Implications for the consumer and
   the industry are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the position of farmer cooperatives in markets and their social
   capital based characteristics, neither the definition nor the role of
   social capital in farmer cooperatives has been broadly investigated.
   Thus, this study seeks to develop a framework for defining and
   clarifying various aspects of social capital and examines the effects of
   social capital on members' participation in collective activities and on
   the economic performance of farmer cooperatives. Social capital is
   indicated in terms of three dimensions, i.e., the external, relational,
   and cognitive dimensions. A statistical model is applied to a database
   consisting of 147 farmer cooperatives in China's Zhejiang province. The
   results demonstrate a positive relationship between certain dimensions
   of social capital and members' participation in training and general
   meetings. In addition, each dimension of social capital has a
   significant and positive impact on the economic performance of

Title = {{The impacts of green claims on coffee consumers' purchase intention}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{195-209}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - As huge environmental impacts caused by the coffee industry
   are significant and controversial in the course from cultivation to
   consumption, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether or not
   different types of green claims based on the product lifecycle can lead
   to different extents of green psychological variables including purchase
   intention.
   Design/methodology/approach - The green claims of Starbucks were chosen
   as the research target for this study not only because the coffee chain
   store is working on the ``Starbucks{''} Shared Planet' program, which
   makes a commitment to do business in ways that are good for people and
   the planet, but also because such a program can be categorized into
   three major green message elements on the basis of the product
   lifecycle. A total of 920 valid self-reported questionnaires collected
   in Taiwan were used for this empirical analysis.
   Findings - One-way ANOVA results reveal that all of the three green
   claims of Starbucks can lead to consumers building up the same level of
   green brand image of this company, with ``ethical sourcing{''}
   significantly possessing more impacts on the other green psychological
   variables (i.e. green trust, green satisfaction, green brand equity, and
   green purchase intention).
   Practical implications - The empirical results and findings from this
   study are helpful to the coffee industry marketers if they, in
   formulating various promotion campaigns, can communicate with the
   consumers with an eye to increasing their green brand image and other
   green psychological variables, including green purchase intention.
   Originality/value - This study is among the first to introduce different
   types of green claims on a basis of the product lifecycle to examine
   whether or not consumers' green psychological variables will be
   different.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{222-233}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess how shelf-life
   labelling affects the sensory acceptability of potato snacks.
   Design/methodology/approach - The panel of assessors determined the key
   sensory attributes. Subsequently, affective sensory consumer testing was
   conducted. The samples of potato snacks with labels suggesting valid and
   false shelf life or without dating information were presented to 110
   students. They rated the degree of colour intensity, oxidised flavour
   and crispness liking with the use of hedonic scale and accepted or
   rejected the sample. The testing was carried out in a sensory
   laboratory.
   Findings - Shelf-life labelling affects the overall acceptability of
   potato snacks, perception of crispness and oxidative flavour. These
   attributes were rated less favourably when the label suggested
   post-expiration. The influence of shelf-life labelling decreased with
   storage time period. Consumers are more willing to trust their own
   perception than labelling.
   Practical implications - The product may be rejected not only because of
   quality depletion when the shelf life is overestimated, but also as a
   result of denigration when the shelf life is underestimated.
   Social implications - Date legislation is necessary but it may be not
   sufficient without consumer education on food labelling and safety.
   Originality/value - Research on the influence of shelf-life labelling on
   the sensory acceptability of food is scarce. Understanding how consumers
   are affected by shelf-life information has important implications for
   both public policy as well as food manufacturers.}},

Pages = {{388-399}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The discourse about agriculture within Switzerland's and
   Germany's public is to be compared in order to obtain an idea about the
   impact of the different agricultural systems. The paper aims to discuss
   this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - After a brief description of agricultural
   systems and policies in Germany and Switzerland, the discourse among the
   general public in the two countries in internet newsrooms and message
   boards is analyzed. The subjects of discussions are compared, and
   selected sequences are analyzed using objective hermeneutics.
   Findings - Results indicate that, in Germany, agriculture is largely
   perceived as a black box where food safety is a crucial issue. Although
   food safety also is discussed in Switzerland, Swiss discussants focus
   more on changes that should be implemented in agricultural production
   and policy systems.
   Research limitations/implications - The quantitative and qualitative
   evaluation of newsrooms and message boards reveals important insights,
   particularly in a comparative setting.
   Practical implications - A small-structured agriculture may contribute
   to generate trust in the reliability of food safety among consumers.
   Originality/value - The discourse on German and Swiss internet platforms
   on agricultural issues reveals significant differences which shows that
   such an analysis allows important insights.}},

Title = {{The linkages between leadership approaches and coordination
   effectiveness A path analysis of selected New Zealand-UK International
   agri-food supply chains}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{443-460}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - A suitable leadership approach and multiple dimensions of
   performance (operational and social dimensions contributing to financial
   performance - the effectiveness of international agri-food supply chain
   coordination) are important because of significant linkages between
   them. However, there has been no such empirical research to explore the
   linkages in five selected New Zealand-UK international agri-food supply
   chains (dairy, meat, apples, onions and wine). Therefore, the purpose of
   this paper is to address this knowledge gap.
   Design/methodology/approach - Before applying covariance-based
   structural equation modelling (a path analysis) on the data collected
   from 112 chain coordinators (CCs) (chief executive officers, managing
   directors and head of departments) of the selected agri-food supply
   chains, a comprehensive process of exploratory factor analysis,
   reliability and validity tests is used to develop the constructs.
   Findings - The findings suggest that CCs' participative leadership
   approach is highly significantly (beta = 0.60; p = 0.00) associated with
   the effectiveness of international agri-food supply chain coordination.
   Directive leadership does not have a significant relationship and its
   interaction effect with participative leadership resulted in a
   significant negative relationship with the effectiveness of agri-food
   supply chain coordination. Moreover, social (satisfaction with and trust
   in supply chain partners) and operational (service and product quality)
   dimensions are the major determinants of financial performance (profit,
   sales and market share) with beta = 0.44 (p = 0.00) and beta = 0.44 (p =
   0.05), respectively. These variables jointly explain 70 per cent of the
   variance in financial performance, and leadership explains 36 per cent
   of the variance in coordination effectiveness.
   Practical implications - In order to understand the multiple dimensions
   of performance and their linkages, the study enhances the understanding
   of CCs and contributes to determine the best practices for modern
   agri-food supply chains.
   Originality/value - This study is the first step in developing and
   confirming complicated linkages with the specific characteristics of
   selected international agri-food supply chains. As a result, the
   empirical evidence also clarifies the earlier ambiguous results on the
   topic raised from other industries or countries.}},

Abstract = {{During the past fifty years, Colombia has endured an internal armed
   conflict. It has left as a result massive forced displacements,
   destruction of the social capital and indiscriminate logging of forests
   in regions affected by illicit crops and a strong presence of illegal
   armed groups supported by drug trafficking. In spite of a number of
   national policies and programs against illicit crops, the issue still
   persists, along with all the social implications it carries with.
   This paper presents a model for planning rural development projects in
   regions with illicit crops. The methodology applied is based on the
   model ``Working With People (WWP){''} and integrates the knowledge and
   experience gathered throughout the implementation of various projects in
   the region of La Macarena, Colombia. It takes into account eight years
   of continuous work with the communities, in one of the areas of greatest
   social unrest in Colombia, due to illicit crops, on-going criminal
   activity and violence by illegal armed groups and a weak presence of
   State institutions. Some of the factors hindering successful advancement
   of rural development policies include the breakdown of the social
   fabric, deterioration of moral values, family disintegration and lack of
   confidence. The conceptual framework applied integrates elements from
   policy analysis and social learning (Friedmann, 1991; Cazorla et al.,
   2015), proposed as a reaction from traditional and ineffective social
   reform models (Friedmann, 1991) developed in this type of scenarios.
   Following a thorough review of rural development planning theories
   regarding illicit crops areas, we carried out an analysis of the
   experience in the Macarena region under the WWP model. The results show
   the effects of the WWP model and the necessity to develop a strategy for
   the eradication of illicit crops in a post-conflict scenario, taking
   into account various social variables. Findings denote a greater
   relevance of the ethical-social and political-contextual dimensions in
   terms of sustainable rural development. Trust building, the enhancement
   of social relationships and direct interaction with target communities
   are the basic factors to the reconstruction of the social fabric and
   value systems, fostering sustainable rural development and
   stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{Resilience is understood as the capacity of rural systems to transform
   and adapt, and this is key to achieving sustainable rural development.
   The aim of the research is to study resilience from a cooperative
   framework based on four concepts: persistence, adaptability,
   transformation capacity, and learning, and to collect successful
   strategies that encourage resilience. The research is part of a project
   called Rethink funded by the European Commission and state agencies of
   14 European countries, included in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)
   and the ERA-NET RURAGRI. The methodology is structured based on a common
   analytical framework that holds the four concepts of resilience applied
   to each of the key stakeholders (cooperative, public sector, private
   sector and civil society). The case study analyzed is a cooperative that
   has more than 25 years' experience in agriculture during which it has
   demonstrated its capacity for renewal and recovery through its working
   model. The analysis covers the entire process of the cooperative, from
   previous experience of farmers, the creation of the company in 2007 to
   its current projects, focusing not only on market strategies, but also
   on its strategic vision and research investment, and on values such as
   trust and respect, on which the cooperative is based.}},

Abstract = {{Social capital is one of the pillars of sustainable development of rural
   areas because the modern village needs educated and enterprising people
   and communities that can adapt quickly to changes and cooperate. The
   main aim of this article is to evaluate the different components of
   social capital and attempt to answer the question whether social capital
   in the rural areas of the Lubelskie Voivodeship differs from the social
   capital in the urban areas of the region. First, the study quotes the
   main definitions of social capital by J. Coleman, R. Putnam and F.
   Fukuyama, and next, separates its components for analysis. The analysis
   of such components as trust, friendship, cooperation, engagement in
   activities for the benefit of local community, participation in
   organisations, obtaining information and the level of communication,
   participation in elections and the assessment of democracy made it
   possible to conclude that, in principle, there are no significant
   differences between social capital in rural and urban areas of the
   Lubelskie Region, which can be explained by the fact that rural areas
   are losing its traditional agricultural character, and the mixing of
   population - the rural population flows into urban areas and the urban
   population settles in the countryside. The evaluation was conducted on
   the basis of questionnaire research commissioned by the Marshal Office
   in Lublin, and carried out on a sample of 1100 residents of the
   Lubelskie Voivodeship.}},

Abstract = {{In this research organizational mechanism is analysed through the
   approach to the system of integrated control of the open system of
   social and economic integration (based on the interests of the

   where the stakeholders formulate the common objectives of the
   sustainable development of the rural areas. Aim of the research-to
   substantiate the conceptual organizational mechanism of development in
   rural areas, where one of the most important factors with the strongest
   effect on functionality, i. e. the driving force, is institutional
   environment of the region. The aim of the research was achieved using
   the following methods: logical, abstraction, comparison, content
   analysis, collation. The results of the research revealed, that
   organizational mechanism of rural areas development is advisable to
   analyse as a particular organizational form, where functions and
   activity processes are connected to each other, creating the following
   chain: aim-sustainable development of rural areas-functions of rural
   areas-process-preparation and implementation integrated development
   strategies of the rural areas-result-social welfare. The exceptional
   feature of the organizational mechanism is the stakeholders (subjects)
   and their actions. Stakeholders perform certain roles, which affect the
   change of environment, in seeking the specific result. Stakeholders with
   a specific aim seek results by performing respective functions and
   processes. In the organizational mechanism of rural areas development
   stakeholders affect the pursuit of the organizational mechanism's aims.}},

Pages = {{157-177}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the purchase behavior
   with regard to innovative food packaging techniques and sociodemographic
   properties of consumers in Turkey (the crossroads of Europe and Asia).
   Design/methodology/approach - The survey was conducted with 365 people
   (around 50 persons for each region) who live in the different regions to
   represent the whole population of Turkey as good as possible.
   Questionnaire methodology was used to achieve the research objectives.
   Multiple-choice test which consists of 24 questions (Table I) were
   selected in order to keep the questionnaire at a reasonable length.
   Questionnaires were distributed to the respondents in small groups for
   effective communication. Multiple correspondence, decision tree and
   prospect profiles statistic procedures were used to identify the
   purchase behavior.
   Findings - In the study, some consumers worried that innovative packages
   might mislead them and therefore sales should be handled under trusted
   brands. Majority of consumers were willing to use innovative food
   packages to prevent the microbial spoilage. Consumers indicated that
   they do not want to see sachets in active food packages due to the
   probability of mistaken. Consumers who chose the price as a first thing
   to get their attention in food packaging, would accept the increase in
   price lesser than 10 percent after seeing the positive impacts of
   innovative packaging. Most of the consumers' (74.79 percent) expectation
   from innovative packaging was the visual ability to observe the history
   and freshness of foods inside the packaging. Participants indicated that
   education through commercials (40.55 percent) would be the most
   effective way in order to increase the overall acceptability for
   innovative packaging.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study was
   that, these questionnaires were applied only to Turkish consumers and
   findings might not be applicable to other countries.
   Practical implications - Better understanding of consumer adoption of
   innovative packages can help to minimize rejection of innovative
   technologies. Knowledge of consumer behaviors toward active and
   intelligent packaging can contribute to developing better industry
   strategies.
   Originality/value - This paper gives the detailed information about
   purchasing behavior of Turkish consumers' regarding innovative packaging
   techniques.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{318-338}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Distrust of conventional food supply systems impacts consumer
   food choice. This in turn has implications for consumer nutrition
   outcomes and acceptance of expert advice regarding food and health. The
   research exploring consumer trust is found across a broad range of
   research streams, and is not cohesive in topic or approach. The purpose
   of this paper is to synthesise the disparate literature exploring the
   interaction between food labelling and consumer trust to determine what
   is known, and gaps in knowledge regarding food labelling and consumer
   trust.
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic search of trust and food
   labelling literature was conducted, with study results synthesised and
   integrated. Studies were then critically analysed for the
   conceptualisation of the consumer, the label, and their interaction with
   a framework developed using social theories of trust.
   Findings - In total, 27 studies were identified. It was found that not
   only is the current literature predominantly atheoretical, but the
   conceptualisation of labelling has been limited.
   Research limitations/implications - Further empirical research is needed
   to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the role food labelling
   plays in influencing consumer trust in food systems.
   Originality/value - This research develops a conceptualisation of the
   dual roles food labelling may play in influencing consumer trust in food
   systems. It distinguishes between trust in food labelling itself, and
   the trust consumers develop in the food supply system through food
   labelling. The novel theoretical model and synthesis provide a
   foundation upon which future research may be conducted.}},

Title = {{Decisional factors driving organic food consumption Generation of
   consumer purchase intentions}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{1066-1081}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how information
   revealed on organic food labels and perceived organic knowledge drive
   consumer trust and attitudes towards organic foods, which in turn
   together with subjective norm eventually influence subsequent purchase
   intentions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire surveys were
   administered to customers at four urban large-scale supermarkets and
   three health food stores at three major cities in Taiwan. In total, 693
   valid questionnaires were obtained, yielding a response rate of 81.5 per
   cent.
   Findings - Trust, serving as the antecedent of attitudes, significantly
   mediates the relationships between revealing information, perceived
   knowledge, and organic purchase intentions. Additionally, both attitudes
   towards organic foods and subjective norm significantly influence
   consumer organic food choices. However, the impact of perceived organic
   knowledge on consumer attitudes has been found to be insignificant,
   indicating that the increase in perceived knowledge cannot create
   positive attitudes towards organic foods. Thus, a focus on how to use
   knowledge to enhance consumer trust in organic foods is suggested as an
   effective marketing strategy for the organic food industry.
   Research limitations/implications - The research findings support that
   trust and attitudes play the mediating roles linking revealed
   information and perceived knowledge with organic food purchase
   intentions. This result is consistent with previous studies, indicating
   that better organic labeling information and related knowledge perceived
   by consumers have critical effects on consumer trust in organic foods,
   which in turn will influence their attitudes and intentions to purchase
   organic foods. However, this study also found that perceived knowledge
   can generate positive attitudes only when trust can be firmly built.
   This confirms the essential role of trust in the process of consumer
   organic buying intentions.
   Practical implications - First, providing credible labeling information
   by displaying how organic agricultural products are grown, processed,
   and handled, and the percentage of organic ingredients in a product is
   crucial to stimulate consumer trust and positive attitudes. Second,
   enhancing consumer trust by providing correct knowledge and credible
   information through diversified channels (e.g. TV, newspapers,
   magazines, web sites) to improve consumer organic knowledge has become
   the most important task for the government, organic food sectors,
   certifiers, and research institutions to develop positive attitudes
   towards organic foods. Finally, organic food sectors and marketers could
   use a word-of-mouth strategy and focus on promoting the benefits and
   accessibility of organic foods to the general public to raise the common
   acceptance of organic foods.
   Social implications - Organic labeling has been considered an effective
   measure to help consumers obtain valid and trustworthy information in
   the organic food market, particularly for those with limited knowledge.
   Therefore, the government agencies not only need to take the
   responsibility to set regulations for organic food/agricultural
   products, but also need to set labeling requirements for these products.
   Based on these labeling requirements, the organic certifying agents can
   certify organic food/agricultural products by offering organic labels
   that contain clear information and represent quality to consumers.
   Originality/value - This study incorporates critical factors based on
   related theories, including the antecedents and the outcome variables of
   consumer trust, to develop a more comprehensive model for better
   understanding of consumer organic choice behaviour. The research
   findings have provided implications and additional contributions to the
   existing theories as well as developed effective strategies for the
   development of the organic food market.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2129-2142}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report how food regulators
   communicate with consumers about food safety and how they believe
   consumers understand their role in relation to food safety. The
   implications of this on the role of food regulators are considered.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 42 food regulators from
   Australia, New Zealand and the UK participated in a semi-structured
   interview about their response to food incidents and issues of food
   regulation more generally. Data were analysed thematically.
   Findings - Food regulators have a key role in communicating information
   to consumers about food safety and food incidents. This is done in two
   main ways: proactive and reactive communication. The majority of
   regulators said that consumers do not have a good understanding of what
   food regulation involves and there were varied views on whether or not
   this is important.
   Practical implications - Both reactive and proactive communication with
   consumers are important, however there are clear benefits in food
   regulators communicating proactively with consumers, including a greater
   understanding of the regulators' role. Regulators should be supported to
   communicate proactively where possible.
   Originality/value - There is a lack of information about how food
   regulators communicate with consumers about food safety and how food
   regulators perceive consumers to understand food regulation. It is this
   gap that forms the basis of this paper.}},

Title = {{Social capital influences farmer participation in collective irrigation
   management in Shaanxi Province, China}},
Journal = {{CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{448-466}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of
   four components of social capital on farmers' participative behaviour in
   collective actions for constructing and operating small-scale
   groundwater irrigation systems on the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi Province,
   China.
   Design/methodology/approach - The four components (social networks,
   social trust, social reciprocity and social participation) were derived
   by employing exploratory factor analysis. Logistic model was used to
   estimate the influence of these components on farmers' participative
   behaviour. Information was obtained from a field survey covering six
   counties in 2011 of Shaanxi Province, China.
   Findings - The findings indicate that considering different components
   of social capital allows for a better understanding of farmers'
   participative behaviour. The authors find that higher levels of social
   trust and social participation lead to a higher propensity for
   collective action, while social reciprocity reduces the probability of
   participation. Other socio-economic factors and farming characteristics
   such as education levels, cultivated area, cropping patterns and grain
   subsidies also have a significant impact.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest creating favourable
   conditions for communication and information exchanges between
   households, which enhance their trust of each other, and encourage
   farmers to participate in collective affairs. Moreover, supportive rules
   are necessary for the future development of collective action. The
   results of this study also have implications for national irrigation
   plans for small-scale irrigation facilities in other developing
   countries.
   Originality/value - A consideration of the different components of
   social capital allows for a more precise understanding of farmers'
   participative behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Food production is becoming very important and it receives priority in
   relation to other activities in the world. As the number of inhabitants
   of the planet grows, food production has greater significance. Its
   production will certainly be affected by climate changes and the
   potential of agricultural land, which will be followed by changes in
   insurance cover of crops.
   Total area of arable land doesn't have the same quality, but it's
   especially common for underdeveloped and developing countries is that
   arable land is not used in the appropriate percent.
   For Serbia which belongs to that group of countries with low yield on
   arable land, it can be pointed out that insurance does not cover a
   sufficient share of that area. The reason for this lies in the lack of
   trust of potential insured, habits and consciousness of the insured,
   economic policy pursued by the state in relation to this issue,
   inadequate training of insurance agents and the lack of proper insurance
   products.}},

   of conventions of quality on consumer choice}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In recent years new forms of food distribution organisation, known as
   short supply chains, have gained ground. The local nature of such
   distribution has positive effects on the environment and on the local
   economy. Consumers appear to trust the short supply chain, and it has
   achieved considerable success. However, the short supply chain has
   credence characteristics which, by their very nature, cannot be
   identified through a system of certification. The question we address in
   this paper is whether it is possible to identify the constituent
   elements of the credence trait in relation to food quality in the short
   supply chain. Our hypothesis is that the latter are linked to a range of
   socially constructed food quality criteria. To develop a more inclusive
   vision of how such criteria are coordinated in food quality assessment
   by consumers, use has been made of convention theory. In accordance with
   convention theory, quality is identified, in a social context and
   informally, as one of the spheres in which economic activity is
   regulated by procedures which go beyond regulation by price. The aim of
   our study was to measure the effects of coordinated conventions of
   quality in the context of one type of short supply chain: farmers'
   markets specialised in the sale of organic products. An ordered logit
   model was implemented. Our results allow credence characteristics to be
   classified within conventions of quality and could help support
   strategies aimed at spreading sustainable forms of food distribution and
   consumption. Future research might go to the direction of validating our
   results based on a single form of supply organisation. Moreover,
   additional efforts should be made understanding the effect of
   situational factors on socio-demographic variables such as gender.
   Finally, an attempt should be made to merge different theories to better
   understand the issue of consumer choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Understanding of Media's risk perception towards GM foods is important
   since media is the direct contact for the public in terms of information
   source for GM foods. How media disseminate information on GM in its
   medium have significant impact on the public opinion and attitude
   towards sensitive issues such as GM foods. The purpose of this paper is
   to explore media's perception of risk towards GM foods in South Korea
   through a qualitative study. The study explicitly compare the difference
   of risk perception of GM foods among two major journalist groups:
   general journalists vs. science-journalists. It is appropriate to
   segregate these two journalist group for the evaluation since they have
   different approach and impact on risk communication of GM foods in South
   Korea. General journalists were found to have relatively limited
   knowledge on GMOs and their attitudes were similar to consumers who have
   vague anxiety for GM foods. Science-journalists were found to have
   relatively higher level of knowledge on GMOs and their attitudes were
   objective and relatively more open-minded compared to the general
   journalist group. This group of journalists appeared to have more trust
   towards gene technology compared to the other group. Findings from this
   study shed light for government in terms how to differentiate risk
   communication strategy for general journalists and science-journalists.

Abstract = {{This study aimed to identify the meaning of local food to consumers in

   uncover the main drivers and barriers towards purchase of local food.
   Data were gathered through a survey of 415 Lithuanian residents. The
   analysis of collected data was performed using the methods of
   mathematical statistics. The results suggest that a majority of
   Lithuanian consumers perceived local food as being produced within more
   than 100 km from their home. Respondents also strongly agreed with the
   definitions of local food as food grown or produced in Lithuania and
   food sold by Lithuanian famers directly to consumers. Three quarters of
   Lithuanian consumers regularly purchased local food and one fourth of
   respondents rarely or never purchased local food. Socio-demographic
   characteristics were not dominant factors in determining who purchased
   local food. Social conscience, health concern and shopping benefits were
   found to be the main drivers of purchasing local food. Alternatively,
   the main barriers were identified as buying inconvenience, lack of

Title = {{Consumer Value perceptions of food products from emerging processing
   technologies: A cross-cultural exploration}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{95-108}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Through a qualitative research approach, the present paper aims to
   explore the range and type of `values' and `costs' in formulating
   overall Consumer Value (CV) perceptions, in association with two
   emerging processing technologies that at the outset are neither
   distinctly positive nor negative in the eyes of consumers, in two
   culturally variant contexts, namely a Western society where technology
   is often met with skepticism (i.e., the UK); and a non-Western society
   where technology plays a reassuring role regarding concerns about food
   safety and quality (i.e., China). Results reveal that the most important
   value and cost dimensions that define CV perceptions are reasoned and
   utility-related, in particular `functional (i.e., economic) value' and
   `performance (i.e, taste-related) cost'. Moreover, additional value and
   cost types of affective nature play an important role, such as
   `emotional value', `(dis)trust' and `(un)familiarity'. Furthermore, a
   number of differences emerge when CV perceptions are related to
   participants' differences in attitude to technological progress (i.e.,
   pro- or counter-technology individuals), lending support to the
   assumption that consumers with different general attitudes towards
   technological progress would differ in the number and type of value-cost
   dimensions that define their CV trade-offs. Finally, a between-countries
   comparison revealed that counter-technology consumers in both cultural
   contexts share more value and cost perceptions than their pro-technology
   counterparts, who `allow' more room for cultural discrepancies to impact
   on their CV perceptions. Overall, findings support the view that CV
   perceptions in the context of food produced by means of emerging
   processing technologies can be successfully analyzed using a
   multidimensional conceptualization, where CV is seen as the outcome of a
   trade-off among a number of `competing' value and cost dimensions. (C)

Abstract = {{We explore whether the creation of the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange

   increasingly governed by formal rather than informal institutions, and
   in response traders have broadened their trading network, rely more
   frequently on traders with whom they do not have social relations, and
   have reduced the provision of credit that cements personalized
   relationships. They also have lower levels of trust in the intentions

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{In March 2011, the United Kingdom's (UK's) Government launched five
   Public Health Responsibility Deal Networks to address public health
   priorities. The Networks used voluntary partnerships to influence
   peoples' choice architecture to move them toward healthier behaviors.
   The purpose of this research was to conduct an exploratory study of
   diverse stakeholders' perspectives about perceived responsibility and
   accountability expectations to improve food environments in England
   through the Food Network partnerships. A purposive sample of policy
   elites (n = 31) from government, academia, food industry and
   non-government organizations sorted 48 statements related to improving
   food environments in England. Statements were grounded in three
   theoretical perspectives (i.e., legitimacy, nudge and public health
   law). PQMethod 2.33 statistical software program used factor analysis to
   identify viewpoints based on intra-individual differences for how
   participants sorted statements. The results revealed three distinct
   viewpoints, which explained 64\% of the variance for 31 participants,
   and emphasized different expectations about responsibility. The food
   environment protectors (n = 17) underscored government responsibility to
   address unhealthy food environments if voluntary partnerships are
   ineffective; the partnership pioneers (n = 12) recognized
   government-industry partnerships as legitimate and necessary to address
   unhealthy food environments; and the commercial market defenders (n = 1)
   emphasized individual responsibility for food choices and rejected
   government intervention to improve food environments. Consensus issues
   included: protecting children's right to health; food industry practices
   that can and should be changed; government working with industry on
   product reformulation; and building consumer support for economically
   viable healthy products. Contentious issues were: inadequacy of
   accountability structures and government inaction to regulate food
   marketing practices targeting children. We conclude that understanding
   different viewpoints is a step toward building mutual trust to
   strengthen accountability structures that may help stakeholders navigate
   ideologically contentious issues to promote healthy food environments in
   England. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper identifies segments of Chinese consumers based on their
   perception of personal risk, how worried they are and their subjective
   knowledge about seven possible food-related hazards: additives,
   residues, counterfeit, inferior, genetically modified, deteriorated and
   nutritionally imbalanced food. Data were collected through a consumer
   survey conducted in Beijing (534 participants) and in Baoding (437
   participants). Three clusters were identified: worried and knowledgeable
   consumers (60.1\%), worried and ignorant consumers (21.7\%) and
   moderately worried consumers (18.2\%). The first two groups reported a
   high level of worry and high perception of personal risk about
   food-related hazards in China. The two hazards they were most worried
   about were counterfeit food and inferior quality food. Television,
   internet and personal communication were the three information channels
   most frequently used by participants to obtain information about food
   safety. Worried and ignorant consumers reported less frequent use of
   magazines, books and brochures compared with other consumers. Medical
   doctors, personal experience and research institutes were the three most
   trusted information sources for the first two groups of consumers.
   Moderately worried consumers only placed high levels of trust in medical
   doctors and themselves. Consumers' perceptions about the knowledge,
   honesty and concern of different information sources significantly and
   positively affected their trust in those sources. The study concludes by
   making recommendations as to how to improve communications with the
   different identified consumer segments and identifies future research
   required to expand its validity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impacts of information on the benefits and
   risks of eating pork on Chinese consumers' attitudes and intentions.
   Data were collected in March 2013 through a consumer survey (n = 909) in
   Beijing and Baoding City. An experiment was conducted using three types
   of message (positive, negative, and balanced) combined with three
   information sources (government research institutes, and the pork
   industry). Participants ate pork almost every second day. They perceived
   pork as rather nutritious and relatively expensive and had neutral views
   about its healthiness and safety. Exposure to negative information
   (about risks only) resulted in a significant and negative change in
   consumers' perceptions of pork's nutritional value, price, healthiness
   and safety, while exposure to positive information (about benefits only)
   caused a positive change in consumers' perceptions about pork's
   healthiness and safety. Exposure to balanced information resulted in a
   significant and negative change in the perceived nutritional value of
   pork. Participants' intended frequency of pork consumption was
   significantly lower after exposure to information, irrespective of the
   type of information received. Exposure to risks-only information
   decreased consumers' intention to eat pork, while exposure to
   benefit-only information had a positive effect on consumers' intentions
   to eat pork. Exposure to balanced risk/benefit information had no effect
   on intended pork consumption. Of the information used, governmental
   materials were found to have a positive impact on consumers' perceptions
   of pork's safety. Implications for communication strategies with Chinese
   consumers about pork consumption are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{The consumer's perception of artificial food additives: Influences on
   acceptance, risk and benefit perceptions}},
Journal = {{FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{14-23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Food additives, such as food colours or sweeteners, play an important
   part in food supply. For a variety of reasons, some consumers might
   regard the use of food additives, especially artificial ones, with
   suspicion; food additives are considered unnatural, unhealthy or even a
   public health risk. The goal of this study was to investigate consumers'
   perceptions and the most essential variables related to the acceptance
   of food additives. Two versions of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire, one
   investigating artificial food colours and the other investigating
   artificial sweeteners, were distributed to a large sample of Swiss
   German households. The final samples for artificial food colours and
   artificial sweeteners comprised 506 and 487 participants respectively.
   The questionnaires contained items on consumers' acceptance, risk and
   benefit perception, trust in regulators, knowledge of regulation and
   their preference for natural products. The relationships between
   variables were investigated in a path model, which was constructed based
   on a review of previous literature. The path coefficients suggested that
   risk and benefit perceptions significantly influence the acceptance of
   the two selected food additives. The risk and benefit perceptions were
   influenced by consumers' knowledge of regulation, their trust in
   regulators, and their preference for natural products. In the
   discussion, the study's findings are examined in terms of their
   implications for further research and for the development of concrete
   communication materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Food forgery is one of the most articulated socioeconomic concerns which
   contributed to increase people's awareness on what they eat and how and
   where it is produced. Consumers are anxious about the consequences of
   food falsification on their choices, religious rituals, health, and
   hard-earned fortunes. The recent scandals of horse and rat meats in
   Europe and China have given us a brainstorming apprehension on the
   detection, differentiation, and identification of meat products. To
   restore consumers' trust and protect wildlife in natural habitats,
   researchers and policy-making and policy-implementing authorities have
   massively monitored all steps in the production of foods and food
   materials. Analytical approaches based on lipids, proteins, and DNA have
   been proposed for the authentication of meat species under pure and
   complex matrices. However, protein and lipid-based methods are less
   effective since the target biomarkers could be modified throughout the
   processing treatments. On the other hand, DNA-based species
   identification schemes have gained wider acceptance and reliability
   because of the superior stability and universality of DNA in all tissues
   and cells. We systematically presented here major species detection
   schemes with special emphasis on multiplex polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) of both end-point and real-time platforms. We believe this short
   but comprehensive review would serve as a reference guide for the
   developers and users of multiplex PCR and others DNA-based techniques.}},
