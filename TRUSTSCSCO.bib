abstract={Introduction: As the globalisation of the food market continues, consumer trust in the food supply chain and the related actors are vital for the functioning of the food industry. While past research has primarily focused on consumer trust within countries and how it can be increased, studies on cross country differences and the comparison between trust and distrust are limited to review articles. To address this gap, this study investigates the levels of trust and distrust in food products and organisations across four European countries (Finland, Germany, Greece and the UK). Methods: Using a previously validated consumer Trust Toolkit (Benson et al., 2020), an online cross-sectional survey explored consumer's trust in food and in food supply chain actors. In addition to this toolkit measuring trust and distrust constructs, the questionnaire for the current study also included relevant sociodemographic, household, and psychological items. The data was analysed using ANOVAs, descriptive statistics and regressions using SPSS v26. Results: Overall, consumers (n = 1027) had a high level of trust in an EU food product (beef burgers; mean = 3.981; SD = 1.353) and the organisations involved in creating and certifying the product (organisations; mean = 4.263 SD = 1.129, food chain; mean = 4.434, SD = 1.177). The data found that Finnish and UK consumers had the highest levels of trust overall, while German and Greek consumers had lower trust in their food and food-related organisations. Interestingly, Finnish consumers reported the highest levels of distrust in food-related organisations, which indicates that food-related distrust is more nuanced than simply being the opposite of food-related trust. These findings are discussed in relation to the cultural context of each country and risk practises. Conclusions: The levels of food trust and distrust differs across countries highlighting the need for developing different business and organisational strategies to market products in different countries/cultures. Understanding consumers’ trust in food and in food-related organisations is the first step in benchmarking and improving consumer trust across Europe. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Trying to meet the Sustainable Development Goals is challenging. Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by ‘soft’ boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food and nutrition security goals. © 2020 Van Voorn et al.

abstract={Over the last years, the trust of consumers in the quality and sustainability of the food system has weakened due to the disconnection between producers and consumers. Alternative Food Networks (AFNs) and Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs), born out of the perceived loss of trust in the globalized food system, are trying to shorten the gap between farmers and consumers. Nowadays, many scholars agree that local and global food systems coexist, and consumers usually buy both in local and in global food chains. Our study aims to understand the factors that affect the development of AFNs with a specific focus on the interactions with small-and large-scale food retailing in the Lombardy region in the north of Italy. We employ an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model, on a municipal scale, in which the dependent variable measures the number of participatory activities carried out by farmers and consumers in AFNs. The main results highlight that conventional large retailers and alternative food networks are linked, and that the coexistence of the two market channels may lead to the development for both of them. Contrarily, where small stores exist, they may compete with an alternative food channel, as they offer similar products and services. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Global food trade has become an increasingly crucial element for feeding the world's population. Enhancing bilateral or multilateral trust in food safety in international food trade is not only important for promoting the sustainable development of trade but is also beneficial for cooperation when facing a global food crisis. However, highly credible traceability systems (TSs) for the cross-border movement of food are still absent in many countries and regions. Blockchain is regarded as a promising technology that can help build trust for transparency and security issues. In this paper, an interconnected conceptual traceability framework based on blockchain is proposed in order to increase trust in food safety during food trade. Taking the food trade between China and the European Union as an example, a conceptual framework is designed in order to take full advantage of existing TSs in these two locations, and the features of logistical flow, data flow, and blockchain flow are analyzed. Considering the data capacity and data privacy level, a hybrid data storage method combining on-chain and off-chain is adopted. Smart contracts according to the features of cross-border food trade—including the recording of exportation data, exporter inspection data, shipment data, importer inspection data, importation data, and tracing queries—are packaged and deployed to a blockchain network. An effective operation mechanism involving the distribution of related rights for different roles is presented. The blockchain-based TS framework has the advantages of enhancing bilateral trust in cross-border food trade, providing a flexible and intelligent technical framework, and having effective operability. Future challenges, such as data security, special smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms, and interoperability with other systems, are discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Traceability systems are a concern in the current food supply chain mainly due to food safety issues. Related traceability problem in the supply chain is the risk of changes in the information on coffee products presented on the consumer's side, thereby reducing their trust in information and customer loyalty on the product. This study aims to analyze the business process of the real-world situation in coffee commodity supply chains, generate a dataset from these observations, and to propose a traceability system design using the clustering approach. The methodology in this research consisted of field observation and desk study, multicollinearity analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis and formulation. The results show that the activities occurring in the coffee commodity supply chain take place between 4 stakeholders, which is indicated by UML. The generated dataset is then compared in correlation so that four variables are selected to use as references in designing the traceability system. Finally, the clustering method shows 4 clusters, where every 2 clusters in 2 existing varieties. The resulting cluster has been able to interpret as much as 84.83% of the dataset tested. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Traceability in the veterinary public health supply chain is essential to increase the value and confidence of meat products consumer. There are challenges in developing a traceability system, which includes what kind of information recorded and presented in the system, system design and architecture to ensure scalability and robustness, and maintaining information integrity. Based on previous research, the role of a user study in traceability system development is essential to ensure the usability of the system. In this research, we conduct a user study to capture the characteristics and perception of livestock consumer in Bogor region. Based on the survey results, we synthesize five design implications that revolve around these matters: traceability system implementation, traceability information conformity, system use for users' easiness, trust increase to the system, and the advantage of blockchain to traceability system. These design implications can benefit traceability system development, primarily concerning veterinary public health, in Indonesia. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent pandemic presses importance on the trade of quality produce from local farmers to consumers. Traditionally, farmers rely on middlemen to sell their produce, resulting in occasional price injustice, and the lack of direct communication with their customers who could be interested in learning more about the produce they consume. To provide trusts using technology instead of an intermediary, this paper proposes a design of a blockchain-based food traceability system for local farmers to sell produce to health-aware consumers who could trace the farming activities of the produce they purchase. The system is based on a private blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric, that supports farmers, carriers, and consumers. Farm activities can be recorded by farmers. Consumers can view produce history before making a purchase, and track transportation by carriers up until delivery. IoT is integrated to record farming environments and quality of farm during plantation is evaluated. This provides a proof-of-concept of how a blockchain-based system can be implemented for local produce marketplace without the need of intermediary. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={China has experienced frequent food safety incidents that have undermined consumer trust in the food supply chain. To overcome this problem, China requalified the legislative framework and adopted a comprehensive food certification system over the years. Here, we investigated the influences of food traceability and Chinese certifications (QS/SC—food quality safety market access/production system, hazard-free, green, and organic) on Chinese consumer trust of food safety for different types of products: fish, meat, milk, eggs, and rice. Data were collected through face-to-face surveys conducted in rural and urban Chinese areas. With a sample of 757 questionnaires, we ran a logit model. The results show consumers’ uncertainty and skepticism of certifications guaranteeing food safety attributes, especially for animal-based products. We found that price is used as a cue of safety by Chinese consumers. Individuals with higher education seem less influenced by certifications and other cues included in the analysis. The findings demonstrate that Chinese policy makers should implement new strategies to enhance consumer food safety trust, and design policies by considering different categories (e.g., vegetables, meat, fish, etc.) of food. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Non-physician clinicians (NPCs) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) often have little physical proximity to the resources–equipment, supplies or skills–needed to deliver effective care, forcing them to refer patients to distant sites. Unlike equipment or supplies, which require dedicated supply chains, physician/specialist skills needed to support NPCs can be sourced and delivered through telecommunication technologies. In LMICs however, these skills are scarce and sparsely distributed, making it difficult to implement commonly used real-time (synchronous), hub-and-spoke telemedicine paradigms. An asynchronous teleconsultations service was implemented in Turkana County, Kenya, connecting NPCs with a volunteer network of remote physicians and specialists. In 2017–18, the service supported over 100 teleconsultations and referrals across 20 primary healthcare clinics and two hospitals. This qualitative study aimed to explore the impact of the telemedicine intervention on health system stakeholders, and perceived health-related benefits to patients. Data were collected using Appreciative Inquiry, a strengths-based, positive approach to assessing interventions and informing systems change. We highlight the impact of provider-to-provider asynchronous teleconsultations on multiple stakeholders and healthcare processes. Provider benefits include improved communication and team work, increased confidence and capacity to deliver services in remote sites, and professional satisfaction for both NPCs and remote physicians. Health system benefits include efficiency improvements through improved care coordination and avoiding unnecessary referrals, and increased equity and access to physician/specialist care by reducing geographical, financial and social barriers. Providers and health system managers recognised several non-health benefits to patients including increased trust and care seeking from NPCs, and social benefits of avoiding unnecessary referrals (reduced social disruption, displacement and costs). The findings reveal the wider impact that modern teleconsultation services enabled by mobile technologies and algorithms can have on LMIC communities and health systems. The study highlights the importance of viewing provider-to-provider teleconsultations as complex health service delivery interventions with multiple pathways and processes that can ultimately improve health outcomes.

abstract={Seafood is an important component of the human diet. With depleting fish stocks and increasing prices, seafood is prone to fraudulent substitution. DNA barcoding has illustrated fraudulent substitution of fishes in retail and restaurants. Whether substitution also occurs in other steps of the supply chain remains largely unknown. DNA barcoding relies on public reference databases for species identification, but these can contain incorrect identifications. The creation of a high quality genetic reference database for 42 European commercially important fishes was initiated containing 145 Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 152 Cytochrome b (cytB) sequences. This database was used to identify substitution rates of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and common sole (Solea solea) along the fish supply chain in Belgium using DNA barcoding. Three out of 132 cod samples were substituted, in catering (6%), import (5%) and fishmongers (3%). Seven out of the 41 processed sole samples were substituted, in wholesale (100%), food services (50%), retailers (20%) and catering (8%). Results show that substitution of G. morhua and S. solea is not restricted to restaurants, but occurs in other parts of the supply chain, warranting for more stringent controls along the supply chain to increase transparency and trust among consumers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The ubiquitous spread of digital networks has created techniques which can organize, store, and analyse large data volumes in an automized and self-administered manner in real time. These technologies will have profound impacts on policy, administration, economy, trade, society, and science. This article sketches how three digital data technologies, namely the blockchain, data mining, and artificial intelligence could impact commercial fisheries including producers, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, management authorities, and scientist. Each of these three technologies is currently experiencing an enormous boost in technological development and real-world implementation and is predicted to increasingly affect many aspects of fisheries and seafood trade. As any economic sector acting on global scales, fishing and seafood production are often challenged with a lack of trust along various steps of the production process and supply chain. Consumers are often not well informed on the origin and production methods of their product, management authorities can only partly control fishing and trading activities and producers can be challenged by low market prices and competition with peers. The emerging data technologies can improve the trust among agents within the fisheries sector by increasing transparency and availability of information from net to plate. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

abstract={A common avenue to enable adoption of technologies and practices by small-scale producers is by means of farmer clusters. These are achieved by building networks and partnerships between farmers and other actors within the supply chain. This paper examines the role that farmer clusters play in the adoption of practices and technologies by shrimp farmers in Vietnam. Understanding the decisions that lead to adoption is important because these have a key impact on sustainable land use in aquaculture. We report on two complementary studies that test the role of farmer clusters in accessing different sources of knowledge and the trust associated with each of the knowledge sources. First, a survey (N = 193) tested the relationship between cluster membership and adoption, and showed that shrimp farmers who are members of farmer clusters are more likely to adopt three types of pond management practices (i.e. water quality management, feed input, and disease control practices). Furthermore, frequency of interaction with, and trust related to, key stakeholder actors could partly explain this relationship. Second, focus group discussions further zoomed into the dynamics that underlie the adoption of technologies and practices by cluster farmers and non-cluster farmers, respectively. We found that input retailers, buyers and hatcheries were only valued for their input on specific products and issues, but not trusted, as the information always needed being verified through testing by, amongst others, neighbors. Consequently, trust relations with these actors can be described as strongly calculative. Farmer clusters increase trust and tighten relationships between members. As a result, members trust each other when verifying information or sharing knowledge acquired from less trusted sources. On the basis of these results, we argue that reliance on existing farmer networks (i.e. clusters) is a viable tool to improve adoption of sustainable technologies and achieve land use planning objectives. Further implications for research and policy are discussed. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Food supply chains are benefiting from blockchain technology, as it establishes a shared, secure record of information flows, thus reducing food safety risks, increasing consumers' trust in products' provenance and enhancing supply chain efficiency. However, despite some embryonic applications, systematic literature review reports very few investigation studies. This article proposes a potential design and update frequency of relevant data to be stored in the Ethereum blockchain for monitoring and traceability purposes and explores the cost connected to every transaction in the case of a fresh milk processing industry and supply chain, from dairy farms to the end consumers. Results show that (i) investments are limited for the supply chain actors; (ii) the benefits of a blockchain-enabled supply chain can be achieved with a minimal impact on the product's consumer price, and (iii) the costs of operating the blockchain increases as we move down along the tiers of the supply chain. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.},

abstract={Public (dis)trust of conventionally produced food is now a pivotal issue for the Canadian food supply chain as consumers are increasingly demanding traceability, transparency and sustainability of the agri-food system. To ensure that Canadians understand what farmers do, how they do it, and why—there has been significant human and financial investment by both the agri-food industry and government over the last decade. Farmers, civil servants, and non-farming agricultural professionals alike are being encouraged to join the national conversation promoting the legitimacy of conventional agriculture. As part of this large-scale effort, women in agriculture (both on and off farm) are advocating, in gendered ways, for the safety and legitimacy of the agri-food system and its conventional farming practices. This is being done by utilizing their motherhood capital. This motherhood capital legitimizes the authority granted to mothers as expert decisionmakers regarding their children’s food consumption. Through the usage of their motherhood capital, women are being positioned—and are positioning themselves—as an important voice in re-narrating the story of conventional agriculture through the circulation of their maternal foodwork experiences. Using their authority as mothers (and feeders or caretakers of families) they are advocating for the safety, necessity, and trustworthiness of conventional agriculture to counter narratives of mistrust and risk. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

However, for the purposes of this paper, it is defined as farm practices characterized by rapid technological innovation, large capital investments in equipment and technology, large-scale farms, single crops (monocultures); uniform high-yield hybrid crops, dependency on agribusiness, mechanization of farm work, and extensive use of pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides. In the case of livestock, it is when animals are highly concentrated and confined. (taken from https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/envirobiology/chapter/9-3-conventional-agriculture/ ). 11 These three provinces are considered the ‘bread basket’ of Canadian agriculture and their economies rely significantly on their agricultural exports (Canadian Rural Revitalization Foundation 2015 ). 12 See for example: ( https://cahrc-ccrha.ca/programs-services/agridiversity/agriwomen/fast-facts ). 13 The results from this study will be made available to the research participants, and the author intends to write several non-academic publications (i.e. blog posts, agricultural newspaper/magazine articles) presenting this research for a larger, popular audience. 14 It should be noted that this position/sector delineation is very generic because of the desire to protect the identity of my participants.

abstract={This paper reviewed the existing and potential blockchain applications of this technology, which are to trade the agricultural wastes including animal wastes, energy, and byproducts among the farmers and entrepreneurs to generate wealth; to manage the animal product supply chains such as dairy products, beef, and chicken to enhance their safety and traceability; and to distribute the funds to refugees and migrants, displaced due to emergencies, to buy various farming inputs including feed. A blockchain is a distributed database of records in the form of encrypted “blocks” (smaller datasets), or a public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties and can be verified at any time in the future. The attributes such as integrity, immutability collaboration, organization, identification, credibility, and transparency of blockchain technology make it ideal for a number of applications in animal production and animal health sectors. Some potential applications of the blockchain technology in the livestock sector, not limited to the ones stated here, are to effectively manage various input supply chains, such as animal feed, de-wormers, medicines, and vaccines, among others; integration of feed composition and environmental footprint databases; and sustainability and technology outreach platforms. Current challenges toward increased application of the blockchain technology are also presented. These topics would serve as the starting points for future applications of the blockchain technology in animal farming. © CAB International 2020},

abstract={The health of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is rapidly declining, driven by multiple stressors including land-based impacts on water quality. For over fifteen years Australian Governments have been investing in programs to promote the voluntary adoption of agricultural practices that reduce nutrient, pesticide and sediment runoff. Insights from monitoring, modelling and research have been used to progressively refine and focus investments over time. Despite this, progress is clearly inadequate to achieve the ambitious program targets. More recently, policy makers have introduced new targets to enhance the active engagement of communities and land managers in programs to improve water quality outcomes. In this review article, we draw on the empirical evidence from the social science literature available from studies within the Great Barrier Reef catchments and consider implications for the current approach being used in Reef programs. Adopting a qualitative evidence synthesis approach, the review examines a nested set of themes: from landholder decision making on practice adoption; participation and engagement in programs; and the influence of the broader policy settings and instruments to deliver government plans and investment. The review highlights the influence of factors such diverse landholder goals and motivations, social and cultural risks of participation, and the benefits of knowledge exchange over knowledge transfer in building trust and commitment amongst landholders. The review also highlights the importance of maintaining collaboration and capacity in industry and natural resource management networks, and, committing to active experimentation and learning at both the farm and program levels. Critical knowledge gaps include the potential for greater participation of supply chain and private actors in program delivery, including exploring the efficacy of ‘smart’ regulation responses, and the impact of re-emergent place-based models for implementation. © 2020},

abstract={Consumers have become increasingly concerned about food safety due to numerous food scandals and incidents over the past two decades. Consequently, they demand to be informed of the processes involved along the food supply chain. Employing a traceability system, tracing food from ‘farm to fork’, has been embraced by the food industries and governments as an important tool to restore and increase consumers’ confidence in food safety. However, there is limited research examining consumers’ perceptions of, and confidence in, the food traceability system to fulfil the role of ensuring food safety. To bridge the knowledge gap, we conducted an online survey of 489 consumers from three major Australian cities. The results suggested that although participants had a great desire to know how their food was produced and handled, it was their understanding of, and confidence in, food traceability systems that strongly predicted their willingness to pay (WTP) for having their food traced. Participants also indicated that, in comparison to locally produced food products, it was more important to have imported food products traced. However, paradoxically, the information provided by the traceability system of imported food products was less trusted. The results highlight that, in order to use the food traceability system to gain consumer trust in food safety, it is critical to inform consumers how the system works to build their confidence in the system. © 2020, Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).},

abstract={The paper investigates the vertical relations along the Italian durum wheat chain and the factors affecting farmers’ behavior in adopting contractual agreements. Sale/crop-growing contracts in the durum wheat sector are analyzed through a direct survey to a sample of 261 durum wheat farmers. The questionnaire collected data on downstream relations and contract terms between farmers and processing and/or marketing firms along the durum wheat chain. A logit model is used to identify factors affecting the likelihood of contract farming between farms and processors. One of the main issues emerging is the low frequency of written contractual forms between durum wheat farmers and downstream operators. In most cases the farmers do not want constraints and reveal a lack of trust in contracts. They prefer to sell their product to a local downstream operator with whom they have a long-standing and solid relationship of trust. Moreo-ver, results of a logistic model show that certain farm features, such as turnover and degree of specializa-tion in durum wheat production, play an important role in driving the decision to adopt written contracts. © 2020, Bononia University Press.

abstract={Studies investigating food safety risk perception (FSRP) have substantially increased in recent years, particularly because of recent cases of food contamination. Most studies analysed the effects of FSRP antecedents and their consequences but reported heterogeneous effects. To consolidate these results and provide a more robust and parsimonious picture of FSRP, we conducted a meta-analysis of 128 empirical studies that investigated the key drivers and outcomes of FRSP and potential moderator variables. Our findings reveal the key drivers (trust, knowledge, subjective characteristics, and socio-demographic characteristics) of FSRP and a robust negative consequent effect on the willingness to buy (WTB). Also, we reveal the moderation role of the food origin, risk type, healthiness, shelf life and pleasure in the consequent effect. Our results contribute to the growing literature related to FSRP by consolidating previous results and help establish a foundation for further advancement in this topic. More importantly, our findings provide a more comprehensive picture of the FSRP phenomenon to help in the design of guidelines and rules that shape supplier behaviour to enhance food safety along the food supply chain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This commentary explores how blockchain technology is being leveraged to improve marine conservation and fisheries supply chain management globally. In doing so, the paper considers the technical and political challenges of building trust and equity for various stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea, and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits. © 2020},

abstract={Compliance is the act or status of complying with an imperative regulatory or normative requirement, that is, compliance means working within boundaries defined by contractual, social, or cultural standards. The aim of this narrative review is to use the food supply chain as a lens of enquiry to distinguish between compliance-based and integrity-based organizational climates and frame and rationalize why deviant behavior arises and how it can be identified. Contemporary theory is explored and critiqued using case studies to contextualize the challenge of organizations promoting supply chain compliance and at the same time recognizing the need for deviant behavior to occur in order to drive innovation and continuous improvement within food supply chains. Deviant behavior can be perceived as either positive in terms of driving continuous improvement or destructive where this behavior has a negative impact on the organization. Although multiple cultural maturity models seek to characterize positive food safety culture and climate, there is minimal research that focuses on the characterization of deviant negative behavior or the development of early warning systems designed to pinpoint signals, traits, or characteristics of this behavior such as low staff morale, theft, property destruction, or absenteeism. The use of cultural maturity models and assessment tools is of value in assisting organizations to translate from a rule, instrumental, or compliance-based organizational climate to an ethically strong organizational climate that focuses on integrity, building trust, and values and a new cultural maturity model is proposed and explored. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists®},

abstract={In order to measure consumer trust in food chain actors and its impact on consumer confidence in food and the technology with which it has been produced, a model was developed relating social trust, beliefs in trustworthiness, overall trust in food chain actors, and confidence in both the supply of food products and food technologies. Data were collected via an online survey in five European countries. Analysis provided support for the model and showed that consumer confidence is largely determined by consumer beliefs about the trustworthiness of food chain actors. In particular the beliefs about openness, and especially about the openness of food manufacturers, are strongly related to consumer confidence. Some national differences in trust and confidence exist. This instrument is shown to be suitable for monitoring the development of, and changes in, trust across countries over time. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Food supply chains are highly complex and involve numerous actors who influence food safety and the integrity of products and processes, both at individual points in the supply chain and more holistically throughout the chain as a whole. Provenance can relate to a particular source or origin of a food and its individual ingredients, and/or relate to claims on how the product is produced and what marketing claims have been attached to the product.The aim of this review is to consider the recent advances in developing transparent data systems to demonstrate food provenance. One technological development is the use of Blockchain, a data handling structure that provides a secure network of information that cannot be changed or destroyed, distributed between supply chain actors. Other developments in information systems that can be used to monitor a range of criteria include geographic information systems (GISs) that can be linked with, for example, stable isotope analysis to provide an indication of provenance for a given product or ingredient.This technology is used as a case study in this paper to demonstrate the opportunities and limitations to such technological approaches.The review reflects on aspects of provenance and the actions that can be taken at organisational and supply chain level to demonstrate transparency so that consumers can have trust in those procuring, processing and supplying food. © CAB International 2020.},

abstract={It is not suggested that any country is intentionally exporting seafood which does not comply with Codex seafood-safety guidelines/codes/standards. However, with an open access resource such as fisheries, there is vast potential for errors to occur along convoluted supply chains, spanning multiple countries, which may negatively impact the safety of edible seafood products imported into Australia. Australian importation policy and inspection procedures are founded upon a bedrock of trust in the integrity, reliability and safety of the global seafood supply chain. In order for seafood imported to Australia to be considered safe the non-mandatory international health standards, governed by Codex Alimentarius, for seafood must be predicated upon the most efficacious methods and stringently governed by each exporting provenance. Currently, tests for zoonotic parasites are not applied to imported edible seafood products on arrival into Australia. Therefore, this critical analysis is aimed at discussing the effectiveness of current testing protocols for zoonotic parasites in edible seafood advised by Codex Alimentarius which may impact the safety of the product imported into Australia. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Wet markets, a ‘traditional’ form of food retail, have maintained their popularity in urban China despite the rapid expansion of ‘modern’ supermarket chains. Their continued popularity rests in the freshness of their food. Chinese consumers regard freshness as the most important aspect of food they buy, but what constitutes ‘freshness’ in produce is not simply a given. Freshness is actively produced by a range of actors including wholesalers, vendors as well as consumers. The paper examines what fresh food means to consumers in the Chinese market. It argues that wet markets create a sense of freshness that resonates with this culinary culture through their sensoria, atmosphere, and trust between food vendors and consumers. Together these respond to desires for and reproduce criteria used to evaluate freshness. Within a fragmented food trade system, wet market vendors have an advantage in offering ‘freshness’ through their ability to connect various wholesalers, agencies, and middlemen, and shorten supply chains. The paper is based on participatory observation, a consumer survey and in-depth interviews of various stakeholders in southern China, especially Sanya in Hainan and Guangzhou in Guangdong. This study suggests that this cultural construction of freshness creates a niche for small-scale players and ‘traditional’ markets in an increasingly concentrated global food system. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={The biorefining of biowaste is an upcoming novel strategy, but is mostly still in its conceptual phase. Biowaste biorefineries would allow (rural) communities to convert their biowaste into value-added biofuels, biochemical compounds, and fertilizers. Several different types of biowaste biorefineries have already been developed, but little to none of these designs are already commercially exploited. Their further development and commercial implementation is hampered by the high investment costs and risks, little trusts in its novel technologies, expected yields and profits, and operating reliability. Modeling these integrated processes, together with their supply chains, would allow for optimizing the considered biorefinery designs and coincidently speeding up the R&D-process. The optimized biorefinery designs and supply chains would additionally embed an increased amount of trust in potential investors in terms of the economic sustainability of the considered novel processes. Therefore, in this publication, a summary of existing biorefinery models is presented, together with supply chain network models. The discussed biorefinery models are categorized according to the conversion platform they use, being thermochemical, biological, or hybrid ones. Furthermore, the overall inherent advantages and disadvantages of all conversion platforms are summarized and a scope of further research needs is presented. © Copyright © 2020 De Buck, Polanska and Van Impe.},

abstract={The United States has experienced prolonged severe shortages of vital medications over the past two decades. The causes underlying the severity and prolongation of these shortages are complex, in part due to the complexity of the underlying supply chain networks, which involve supplier-buyer interactions across multiple entities with competitive and cooperative goals. This leads to interesting challenges in maintaining consistent interactions and trust among the entities. Furthermore, disruptions in supply chains influence trust by inducing over-reactive behaviors across the network, thereby impacting the ability to consistently meet the resulting fluctuating demand. To explore these issues, we model a pharmaceutical supply chain with boundedly rational artificial decision makers capable of reasoning about the motivations and behaviors of others. We use multiagent simulations where each agent represents a key decision maker in a pharmaceutical supply chain. The agents possess a Theory-of-Mind capability to reason about the beliefs, and past and future behaviors of other agents, which allows them to assess other agents’ trustworthiness. Further, each agent has beliefs about others’ perceptions of its own trustworthiness that, in turn, impact its behavior. Our experiments reveal several counter-intuitive results showing how small, local disruptions can have cascading global consequences that persist over time. For example, a buyer, to protect itself from disruptions, may dynamically shift to ordering from suppliers with a higher perceived trustworthiness, while the supplier may prefer buyers with more stable ordering behavior. This asymmetry can put the trust-sensitive buyer at a disadvantage during shortages. Further, we demonstrate how the timing and scale of disruptions interact with a buyer’s sensitivity to trustworthiness. This interaction can engender different behaviors and impact the overall supply chain performance, either prolonging and exacerbating even small local disruptions, or mitigating a disruption’s effects. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these results for supply chain operations. © 2020 Doroudi et al.

abstract={Farmed oysters are one of the most valuable aquacultured products in the United States (U.S.), are highly perishable, and increasingly shipped live year-round. Supply chain actors must work together to bring refrigerated oysters to market quickly, while maintaining product value, safety and traceability information. In light of these demands, this study assesses the performance and conduct of supply chains for U.S. farmed oysters (Crassostrea virginica, C. gigas). Over the two-year study period, we conducted interviews with 56 businesses and tracked 125 oyster shipments from two major growing regions in the U.S. through six different types of supply chains. We hypothesized that direct and intermediated supply chains would perform differently in terms of time-to-market, product temperature in cold chains, compliance with temperature regulations, and modeled risks from Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Intermediated supply chains, by their definition have more connections than direct supply chains, and we found this introduces a longer time-to-market and a higher incidence of time and temperature abuse. However, these factors did not lead to greater modeled V. parahaemolyticus risks. Participants in both direct and intermediated supply chains were aware of the importance of traceability and felt uniformly positive about their ability to perform recalls. A common concern was the speed of government-imposed recalls, which can be declared by regulators after the affected live oysters are consumed. Members of these supply chains play different roles in maintaining the cold chain, possess different levels of information related to traceability, and describe different levels of trust with other supply chain actors. This paper contributes to a growing body of knowledge on supply chains for seafood and their critical, and sometimes overlooked, role in larger food systems. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate supply chain relationships in an urban local fresh food system from a retailer perspective to examine the types of relationships and the factors underpinning the development of such relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Using the multiple case study method, interview data from twelve urban local fresh food retailers in Sydney were analysed using the thematic analysis. Findings: This study finds that balanced power relationships in the supply chain allow reasonable power to sit with growers in product price determination irrespective of the dependency of small-scale growers on relatively large local retailers. Trust-based relationships are developed over multiple transactions, where shared values across the supply chain and consistently low opportunistic behaviour in reward sharing are demonstrated to be the crucial factors underpinning close relationships. This study also found evidence of horizontal supply chain linkages among retailers in a competitive environment. Practical implications: Findings of this study have implications for policymakers in designing urban fresh food systems and for practitioners in large urban retailers including supermarkets that attempt to integrate local food into their product portfolio. Originality/value: This study extends the local food system literature dominated by rural studies to include new knowledge about the dynamics of collaborations in contemporary urban local fresh food supply chains. It provides the first empirical evidence of lateral inventory transshipment between retailers in a competitive environment confirming previous simulation studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We illustrate how disruptions in conventional and alternative food supply chains in both countries have had different effects on consumers. Our experiences, when juxtaposed, suggest that even in the case of abundance of food supply, shorter food supply chains prove to be more resilient against disruptions during the pandemic. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={A cross-sectional study design was employed for the purpose of understanding the postharvest practices and entry point for losses along the supply chains of Solanum aethiopicum and Amaranthus lividus leafy vegetables. This is important so that interventions along the supply chain may not be misplaced. The target population included chain actors: farmers (n=10), traders (n=30) and key informants (n=7) who were selected purposively for interviews. A total of 10 farms and 7 market visits were made along the two supply routes: Kabubbu-Kalerwe and Kabubbu-Kireka. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and key informant checklist. Two supply chains were observed in this study: short supply chain where the farmer doubled as a trader. Farmers in this category were the majority (90%). In the long type, farmers (10%) supplied middlemen/transporters who then delivered to the markets. Furthermore, there were no exports or value addition in either of the supply chains. A good hygiene practice observed on the farm was that of trimming off the roots of vegetables to reduce contamination from the soil and also the amount of garbage generated in the market. Packing of vegetables on hired trucks was a common practice where roots/leaves faced each other to prevent soiling of the leaves by the roots. The main transport means used was truck (100%) with alternative transportation means being motorcycle and bicycles. The cool evening hours (20:00 to 00:00hrs) were the most preferred transportation times. The packaging method observed in the market was use of either black or white polythene bags at the point of sale with only 53.3% of the traders packaging for their customers. There was no proper packaging and storage both on the farms and in the markets. Traders in the markets either sprinkled water on the leftover vegetables or covered them with a wet sack as a preservation method. Moreover, only 16.6% sorted and graded their vegetables whereas 83.4% did not. There was inappropriate handling, storage and packaging practices along the two supply chains. © 2020 African Scholarly Science Communications Trust (ASSCAT).},

abstract={Farmer producer companies are seen as an institutional arrangement to provide market access and sustainable livelihood to small farmers. In India, more than 4,200 producer organizations were registered over the last 8–10 years to mobilize millions of farmers to enhance their income through collective action. However, most of these organizations are at an early stage of establishing themselves amidst several hurdles. This study attempted to understand the challenges faced by the farmer producer companies (a type of producer organization) with the help of primary data collected through interviews of the CEOs of 36 such companies in West Bengal, India. The study also analyzed the issues concerning developing a supply-chain by producer companies with institutional buyers based on a real-time experiment, which involved examining the process of supply of vegetables to a bulk purchaser. The study found a lack of trust and awareness among the farmers to be significant hurdles to form producer companies. Inadequate training, inept management, and poor organizational skills of the members challenge the functioning of such companies. Further, some of the inadequacies in the supply-chain of a producer company, as found in the experiment, can be improved by the coordinated use of technology, training, and planning. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Small food businesses, because of their limited resources, are hard pressed to comply with the requirements of a conventional food safety management system (FSMS). To overcome it, the European legislation provides some flexibility in the application of FSMS. With this study, we evaluated the change in the perception and awareness of hazards in food production and in the attitudes of food business operators (FBOs) after a regional regulation was introduced to allow flexibility and a campaign of training activities on the FSMS simplification opportunities. Training activities targeting various stakeholders have been carried out in Piedmont region since 2014. A total of 283 FBOs from the dairy and the meat supply chains were recruited for a two-round survey. Overall, the majority of the FBOs believed that application of an FSMS helps to overcome official controls, to produce healthy foods, to better manage the production process, and for staff training; its usefulness for enhancing customer trust was judged of limited value. FBO knowledge on the possibility of simplifying the FSMS activities increased significantly between surveys, suggesting the success of the information campaigns. Over time, simplification increased in the meat but not in the dairy supply chain, where it involved nearly 70% of FBOs. The cost of FSMS (mainly due to microbiological analysis) and the time it takes were the main reasons for FBO resistance to its application. Simplification of FSMS procedures were welcomed by the vast majority (>90%) of FBOs. The perception of hazards was low and generic, suggesting the need for targeted training activities. ©Copyright: the Author(s), 2020 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.},

abstract={Ubiquitous utilization of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has led the governments of various countries to use ICTs in public administration and social welfare initiatives. Direct use of e-governance technology by citizens in developing countries is hindered by lack of training, education and infrastructure. This makes it inevitable to employ intermediary users who can bridge this gap between technology use and beneficiaries. Analyzing the technology adoption behavior of intermediaries could help policy makers and designers of e-governance technologies to create devices, processes and training programs that target the factors that inhibit as well as encourage the use of ICTs among technology users. We study the effect of technology characteristics and users' internal traits on technology satisfaction of intermediaries who are mandated by the government to use android tablets in order to provide efficient services to end-users in the Indian food security supply chain. We further translate the results into tangible recommendations in context of infrastructure, users' traits, business performance, and technology and policy design. The research model proposes that certain technology characteristics (screen design, technology relevance and terminology) and users' internal traits (resistance to change, technology anxiety, trust in internet and result demonstrability) influence their technology satisfaction, either directly or indirectly through UTAUT constructs. Results indicated that resistance to change, technology anxiety, trust in internet, screen design and terminology had an impact on ICT users' technology adoption behavior. Result demonstrability and technology relevance were found to have no effect on technology satisfaction in case of mandatory use. © 2020, CentMa GmbH.},

abstract={This chapter outlines what organic means in Canada and how domestic and international consumers can recognize and trust that organic food, seed and animal feed products both within and from Canada are healthy and safe. Specifically, it discusses the regulatory requirements that producers must meet for their products to be certified as organic by Canada. This includes recognized principles of sound organic farming and supply systems covering production, processing, storage, transportation, labelling and marketing. It also discusses how importers of organics can meet Canadian regulatory standards by accessing accredited certification bodies recognized by Canada or by utilizing an existing mutual recognition organic equivalency agreement with Canada. The chapter then discusses the growing demand for Canadian organics domestically and internationally. Specifically, it assesses the growing demand for certain organic products from Canada and the reasons for it. In short, the chapter outlines Canada’s efforts to enhance its capacity to enhance organic agri-food trade opportunities by promoting long-term relationships that include reducing trade impediments through reciprocity, harmonizing food safety regulatory regimes, instituting transparent organic certification standards and investing in world-class cold supply chain distribution systems. By doing so, the chapter explores the relationship between consumer confidence and food security from a Canadian perspective as an open and trustworthy trading nation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how consumers’ trust is enhanced by e-commerce-based agribusiness companies. It also aims to shed light on the role of social commerce in improving consumers’ trust. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research purpose, an in-depth multiple case study is performed. In this study, three cases in short food supply chain (SFSC) in China are selected, and they are all e-commerce agribusiness companies. They adopted common ways to build up, maintain and reinforce consumers’ trust. Findings: It is revealed that the companies innovatively adopted social commerce, both online and offline, to overcome the trust problems usually faced by e-commerce companies. It is also shown that offline contact with potential consumers is an important first step for agribusiness e-commerce entrepreneurs to build up trust with consumers. Research limitations/implications: By adopting a multiple case study method, the research has limited generalizability to other types of SFSCs. Since the findings are from Chinese agribusiness e-commerce companies, the generalization to other sectors must be done with caution. Practical implications: Some managerial implications are given as follows: first, offline contact with consumers could be realized through different channels. Taking advantage of existing social network or trying to find consumers in urban communities might be effective ways. Second, trust building with consumers is not an easy task, managers need to emphasize trust building, trust maintaining, as well as trust reinforcing with consumers. In agri-food sector, managers might need to specifically address the importance of food safety and quality so as to not lose consumer trust in one night. Originality/value: The study has mainly two contributions: first, it has managerial implications for agribusiness e-commerce entrepreneurs, addressing the important role of social presence in building up consumer trust. Second, it contributes to social presence and social relations literature by providing new empirical evidence from e-commerce in agri-food sector and in developing countries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background: Food fraud results from deliberate criminal intent to adulterate or misrepresent food, food ingredients or packaging, and is motivated by economic gain. Its occurrence has been identified across various supply chains within local, regional and global food systems, including within Europe. Incidents of food fraud may negatively impact on consumer confidence of the food industry and in regulatory mechanisms designed to prevent or mitigate food fraud. A systematic analysis of the impacts of European food fraud incidents on European consumer perceptions and attitudes is presented. Scope and approach: Three databases were searched, yielding 15 studies. Thematic analysis of the results yielded six themes “drivers of fraud”, “consumer fraud concerns”, “consumer perceptions and attitudes following a food fraud incident”, “responsibility, accountability and blame” and “consumer behavioural response”, and “supply chain responses”, but not increased food risk perceptions. This may be an artefact of the search language (English) used, the time period of the search (20 years from 1998) and because academic interest in food fraud as a distinct topic of study has been relatively recent, in particular from a risk perception perspective. Key findings and conclusions: Understanding consumer perceptions and attitudes towards food fraud, authenticity, and trust will facilitate industry and governmental priorities about food fraud prevention strategies, mitigatory actions and communication about these with the public. However, research is needed which links the perceptions and attitudes of consumers in countries to specific incidents, and to assess the impacts of preventative and mitigatory actions in relation to consumer confidence in affected food supply chains and food supply system more generally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify how the relationship between inbound logistics (IL) activities and elements of resilience (EoR) can contribute to organisational resilience. Design/methodology/approach: Two in-depth case-based studies were conducted in the dairy industry. After identifying EoR and IL activities through a systematic literature review, relationships among them have been empirically discussed in six groups (emerged content analysis results): supplier and response capability; transportation; security; quick response to disruption; logistics management; trust and knowledge. Findings: A framework was developed describing the contribution of these six groups to organisational resilience by highlighting and discussing three aspects: rigidity of the hierarchy, type of relationship and geographical dispersion. These aspects emerged from the process of content analysis and are related to the companies’ characteristics. Practical implications: The proposed framework can assist managers to decide which group of EoR and IL activities they should prioritise, depending on the company’s characteristics and needs. Originality/value: Although some studies have discussed the IL contribution to generating resilience in companies, none of them have explored in detail the relationship between EoR and IL activities, and their contribution to organisational resilience. The proposed framework shows the contribution of the EoR to three different organisational aspects. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Food safety has become an important topic in people's daily lives. In recent years, the frequent occurrence of food safety incidents have caused a crisis of trust between consumers and the food industry. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to establish an efficient and trusted traceability system for agricultural products. In the practical application of the traditional traceability system, the data of the production, processing, packaging, transportation, storage and sales of agricultural products are stored in the local database of each node, data in traditional traceability systems is centralized, and authoritative agencies manage the central database of the traceability system. Because the traceability data of each supply chain node is managed by the enterprise itself, the data is easy to be tampered with. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the reliability of information transmission between different roles in agricultural supply chain.Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, traceability, and high availability. Using these characteristics of blockchain and using blockchain technology to trace agricultural products, it is possible to solve the problems existing in the current traditional traceability system.At present, Scholars in China and abroad have studied the application of blockchain in the field of traceability. However, the traceability system of blockchain have some problems, such as low query efficiency, high data-storage load, and poor data privacy and security. In order to solve the above problems, this study designed a storage structure for a blockchain-based traceability system for agricultural products based on Hyperledger Fabric and proposed an index storage and query method for gtraceability information. In this method, "On chain and off chain" data storage technology is used, the enterprise first digitally signs the hash value of the traceability information of agricultural products, writes the hash value into the blockchain, and returns the block number to the blockchain where the hash value is located. Then, the traceability information of agricultural products and the block number are stored in the local database of each node. If the information of agricultural products needs to be modified, it is necessary to rewrite the hash value of the traceability information to the blockchain and update the block number. When consumers scan the QR code of agricultural products, the traceability information and block number is obtained from the local database, the value is calculated by hash algorithm for the acquired traceability information, and compare it with this newly acquired hash value with the hash value stored in the blockchain by block number to verify the authenticity of traceability information of agricultural products. The result showed that, when the number of total traceability records reached 11×104 in the blockchain and the number of batch traceability records was 400 respectively, the query efficiency of the newly proposed method was increased by 70.56% and 88.66% compared to two traditional blockchain-based data query methods of query performed using the value of key attribute and querying performed using the batch number of agricultural products through the rich query of the CouchDB database, respectively. The approach of this paper effectively solves the problem of excessive load pressure of blockchain data storage, ensures data privacy and security, and improves the reliability and timeliness of traceability information. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={A series of food safety incidents related to domestically produced dairy in China harmed consumer confidence and caused a dramatic decrease in dairy consumption from 2008 to 2010. Compared with previous studies that mainly assessed consumer confidence in food or dairy in general, this study focused on 2 specific dairy products, milk and infant milk formula (IMF). Based on data from 934 Chinese consumers, confidence in the safety of milk and IMF was measured by using a multi-item scale with 2 dimensions—optimism and pessimism. We found that Chinese consumers were optimistic about the safety of milk and IMF but, at the same time, were concerned about the risks related to milk and IMF. Chinese consumers have less confidence in IMF than in milk. Structural equation modeling indicated that consumer trust in manufacturers and third parties in the dairy supply chain and confidence in other foods, such as meat and fish, can foster consumer confidence in the safety of milk and IMF, while the extent of recall of the melamine infant formula incident in 2008 and trait worry exert negative effects. In addition, consumers with more children or less family income are likely to be more confident in domestically produced IMF. These insights into consumer confidence and its determinants can assist dairy supply chains and regulatory institutions in formulating effective risk communication strategies to strengthen consumer confidence. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={The present study aimed to investigate, from a psychological perspective, the elements that are able to predict attitudes to, and purchases of, organic products. Our specific focus was organic milk due to the reputation established by this product over the years, especially thanks to sales by large retailers. The analysis was performed within the theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior, which was extended to include trust in supply chain actors and self-identity of the consumers in question as “green consumers”. A large sample of Italian consumers (n = 1509) was interviewed in two stages in order to obtain data regarding both intentions and actual behavior in respect of organic milk purchase. Our results suggest that TPB is, indeed, a predictive model for explaining organic milk purchase intentions and behavior. Furthermore, it can be successfully extended to elements such as self-identity and trust. Yet among all the dimensions of trust in the different actors of the supply chain, only trust in farmers was supported by our results. Therefore, campaigns aimed at fostering trust in farmers could reinforce the position of this food category when required. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Fellow's address begins by noting several recent consumer food trends and the changing way in which we perceive value-added. I then focus on the topic of heterogeneity in consumer behavior, reviewing contributions from the literature that enhance our ability as economists to model and measure heterogeneity. Supply chain responses to consumer heterogeneity are examined, including a discussion of information flows within supply chains and the role of certification and verification. I close with a consideration of policy implications flowing from consumer heterogeneity. © 2019 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society},

abstract={Long supply and complex fresh produce supply chains provide opportunity for fraudulent activity to occur especially further processing or re-packing of products to mask opaque practice and non-compliant behaviour. Price premiums for products designated as ‘high-value’, for example, organic produce, produce of particular provenance, or geographical production area provides motivation for less scrupulous actors to present for sale, produce that is mislabelled or misrepresented. People integrity as well as data, product and process integrity are gaining wider attention in the horticultural sector. Types of fraud critiqued in this review paper include mislabelling, substitution or misrepresentation of origin (country or regional location), method of production (organic or conventional) or incorrect varietal declaration. These challenges and the existing and emerging technologies that are both used within a quality assurance programme and alternatively used by regulators when investigating potential instances of fraudulent behaviour are considered. New methodological solutions and approaches are emerging and such techniques will develop rapidly to meet the growing challenge of fraud and to ensure consumer trust in the industry is maintained especially as types of food fraud evolve and become more sophisticated. © 2019, © 2019 The Journal of Horticultural Science & Biotechnology Trust.},

abstract={Vegetable farming is the main source of livelihood for smallholder farmers in Eswatini. However, the production and marketing challenges they faced inhibits the farmers from benefiting fully, which calls for relational transactions to enhance exchange efficiency. Therefore, this study aims to determine the nature of relationship constructs between vegetable farmers selling to formal and informal channels. Data elicited from 170 farmers were analysed using factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis. Results revealed that farmers derived satisfaction from the price offered and communication, while trust was derived from satisfaction, communication and duration of the relationship, and commitment was derived from trust in both channels. The discriminant analysis results revealed that there is statistical significant difference between the channels. Farmers supplying formal markets perceived levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment better than those supplying informal markets. The results also indicated that satisfaction and trust were the best predictors of the nature of the relationships. The lack of written contracts and low produce quantity purchased by the formal markets contributes to the low-level establishment of the farmer-buyer relationships. Therefore, coordinated supply chains and supplier-development approaches are necessary to complement the logistical requirements associated with fresh produce and to create mutual benefits. © 2019, © 2019 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

abstract={Purpose: With recent shifts in market forces driven by food safety and quality concerns, managers in the Brazilian beef processing industry are forced to reevaluate their procurement arrangements with cattle producers. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight on the effect of live-weight (LW) and dead-weight (DW) procurement arrangements on farmers’ incentives to invest in cattle quality. Design/methodology/approach: The research methods involve a conceptual model based on principal-agent framework and data from targeted interviews of cattle farmers and slaughterhouse managers in the Western Region of São Paulo state of Brazil. Findings: Findings highlight the potential for adverse selection of low-quality cattle producers under LW arrangement and misaligned incentives for quality improvement, they also illustrate incentive compatibility of DW arrangement when the carcass yield is verifiable by producers. The evidence from field data was largely consistent with the predictions of the model and highlighted the important role of trust for a lasting procurement relationship under DW arrangement. Research limitations/implications: Due to the lack of publicly available data and the challenges associated with the collection of primary field data, the sample is limited to 30 cattle producers and 5 processing firms. Originality/value: This paper provides a theoretical and empirical platform for developing further research on coordination at the producer–processor interface of beef supply chain in Brazil and other countries with similar transaction characteristics. The findings will assist in designing more incentive compatible and self-enforcing arrangements between cattle farmers and slaughterhouses to enhance the product quality and the overall efficiency of the supply chain. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={New food technologies, such as genetic modification, food fortification, and processing technologies, are of growing interest for future food security and safety. For ensuring successful implementation of such technologies, consumers and other food supply chain actors should embrace them. We present a systematic review to identify and compare key factors of supply chain actors’ evaluation of new food technologies. Evaluation encompasses indicators such as likelihood or intention to perform a behavior, perceived benefits/risks, willingness to pay, acceptance/adoption, and attitudes. Results from 183 studies showed several imbalances in research. Although studies mainly focused on (1) genetically modified foods, (2) by consumers, (3) in developed countries, only very few studies have targeted other food technologies, other supply chain actors such as farmers (13 studies) or processors (two studies), or developing countries (43 studies). With respect to consumers’ evaluation, key determinants were trust in institutions, information assessment, perceived risks and benefits, attitudes toward the product or technology, perceived behavioral control, quality perception of the product, and impact on health. Farmers’ evaluation of new food technologies was explained by the factors of perceived risk and benefits and of actual source of information. For the few processor evaluation studies, no convergence of factors could be reached. This systematic review contributes to a better understanding of consumers’ and farmers’ evaluation behavior and opens up avenues for future research on supply chain actors’ food technology evaluations. The differences in the conceptualization and measurement of extracted factors demonstrate the need for standardized approaches in future studies. © 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®},

Seafood is one of the most traded food commodities in the world with demand steadily increasing [1]. There is, however, a rising concern over the vulnerability of seafood supply chains to species mislabelling and fraud [1,2]. DNA methods have been widely used to detect species mislabelling and a recent meta-analysis of 4500 seafood product tests from 51 publications found an average of 30 percent were not the species stated on the label or menu [3]. This high rate poses a serious threat to consumer trust, reputations of seafood businesses and the sustainability of fishery resources. Seafood certification schemes may help reduce this problem. Here, we use DNA barcoding [4] to validate the species identity of 1402 certified seafood products derived from 27 species across 18 countries and find that in over 99% of cases species labelling was correct. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as blockchain, has the potential to transform supply chains. It can provide a cryptographically secure and immutable record of transactions and associated metadata (origin, contracts, process steps, environmental variations, microbial records, etc.) linked across whole supply chains. The ability to trace food items within and along a supply chain is legally required by all actors within the chain. It is critical to food safety, underpins trust and global food trade. However, current food traceability systems are not linked between all actors within the supply chain. Key metadata on the age and process history of a food is rarely transferred when a product is bought and sold through multiple steps within the chain. Herein, we examine the potential of massively scalable DLT to securely link the entire food supply chain, from producer to end user. Under such a paradigm, should a food safety or quality issue ever arise, authorized end users could instantly and accurately trace the origin and history of any particular food item. This novel and unparalleled technology could help underpin trust for the safety of all food, a critical component of global food security. In this paper, we investigate the (i) data requirements to develop DLT technology across whole supply chains, (ii) key challenges and barriers to optimizing the complete system, and (iii) potential impacts on production efficiency, legal compliance, access to global food markets and the safety of food. Our conclusion is that while DLT has the potential to transform food systems, this can only be fully realized through the global development and agreement on suitable data standards and governance. In addition, key technical issues need to be resolved including challenges with DLT scalability, privacy and data architectures. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Linking smallholder farmers to high-value markets through contract farming has become an important strategy to increase farm incomes in developing countries. However, various forms of opportunistic behaviour have been reported, threatening the sustainability of inclusive supply chains. When formal institutions are weak, informal codes of conduct like trust can be important complements to facilitate market transactions. We explore the effect of opportunistic behaviour on farmers’ trust, using a field-framed trust experiment with prior signaling with small-scale farmers in Ecuador. These farmers are linked to different types of markets, including high-value export chains, and have been exposed to varying levels of opportunistic behaviour in the past. Our unique dataset allows us to control for self-selection of game participants. We find that a positive signal triggers a positive response increasing trust, while a negative signal has no effect – possibly reflecting very low overall trust levels. In settings where market linkages have failed previously, ex-ante credible positive signals could help to build trust and encourage small farmers’ participation in sustainable value chains. © 2018 The Agricultural Economics Society},

abstract={The Australian Lot Feeders Association complains that animal welfare activists and airborne drones are probing their feedlotting practices. The object of this article will be to analyse critically the public interest in the export of live animals for purposes of destination market slaughter, with the industry’s corporate interests. According to former Australian High Court Chief Justice French, public decisions must be made lawfully, rationally, fairly and intelligibly. The question arises as to whether decisions in the export supply chain of live animals comply with these criteria, and does the live animal export trade constitute a major breach of public trust? The prevailing public view, and therefore the public interest, may be inferred from the available facts, suggesting that the live animals export industry is only apparently in conformance with an international regulatory system. Authorities appear to have taken the side of corporate live animal export interests, and their apparent desires for production efficiencies, distorting the public rhetoric to manipulate the public interest, and reducing the quality of humane treatment of animals. On board many ships, animals have been severely ill-treated and tortured, enduring suffering through high temperatures, a lack of fresh or sufficient air causing death, and the further painful suffering of deadly diseases. Although apparently lawful, the trade does not appear rational, fair or intelligible, thus amounting to a large-scale breach of the public trust. © 2019, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

abstract={Despite the advantages ensuing from preferential market access agreements, trade exchanges between Southern Mediterranean Countries (SMCs) and the EU are often hindered by food safety issues. These are particularly relevant for fruit and vegetables, which are subject to heterogeneous regulations in SMCs. This paper seeks to outline governance solutions to improve ex-ante compliance capacity of SMCs production and to enhance integration with the EU market. A set of research hypotheses, concerning the difficulties and benefits related with food safety compliance, are formulated. These hypotheses are then discussed in the light of the empirical evidence gathered from (i) public bodies involved in food safety enforcement and (ii) a direct survey conducted on 37 stakeholders in the fruit and vegetable supply chain in Italy. The main problems identified relate to the scarce harmonization among control systems in EU Member States and insufficient checks in exporting countries. The main benefits include the reduction of sanitary risk and the reinforcement of long-term trust-based relations along the supply chain. The most promising strategies encompass the improvement of inspections on production sites and of infrastructures in the countries of origin. Further areas of intervention concern the harmonization of food safety regulation between EU countries and SMCs and the development of bilateral cooperation and technical training programs. © 2019, Bononia University Press.

abstract={A series of food safety incidents has led to low levels of trust in the safety of domestically produced Chinese infant milk formula. Concerned parents in China increasingly source ‘foreign-produced’ brands and use a range of authenticity cues as assurance of the safety and authenticity of infant formula products. However, the effectiveness of authenticity cues in providing assurance to Chinese consumers has not been evaluated. The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of various authenticity cues for infant milk product choices. Latent class models were used to analyse responses to an online choice experiment with 350 consumers of European infant formula in three Chinese cities: Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu. The model included respondents’ preferences for different labels, authenticity cues and price along with perceptions, attitudes, and socio-demographic characteristics. We identified two consumer segments, with one preferring lower priced infant formula and the second choosing higher priced products. All authenticity cues, including price, appear to serve as indicators of food quality and safety, and all were found to be highly important information sources for the respondents when making purchase decisions. In general, Chinese consumers are prepared to pay a premium for authenticity assurance. Chinese policy makers and the infant formula industry should continue to improve quality control systems to increase consumers’ trust in food value chains. These control systems should comprise the whole food supply chain, from production to marketing, and should focus on building trust and communicating credibility. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Incentive systems aim to motivate and direct the behavior of participants in inter-organizational relationships. Cooperative incentives are based on sharing of benefits and gains generated in relationship, while the competitive ones refer to rewarding suppliers based on their performance relative to other suppliers. Based on the Relational View lens, the study aimed to analyze how competitive and cooperative incentives from the purchasing company influence the economic results of its suppliers. A qualitative research was carried out through a case study, whose unit of analysis was the dyadic relationship in an organic products supply chain. The results showed that the purchasing company uses competitive incentives when it seeks to encourage suppliers to adopt behaviors in order to avoid punishment, especially in relation to productive activities. Cooperative incentives also promote information exchange, knowledge transfer and trust-based relationships. As a theoretical contribution, in the organic production context, it was identified that beyond the influence of competitive and cooperative incentives over the relations between buyer and suppliers there are external factors such as international certification standards and regulations, which exerts a strong influence on the studied relation. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Economia e Sociologia Rural.},

abstract={The area of agricultural land in organic farms in Poland accounted for 5.2% of organically farmed land in the EU28 in 2015 and 3.4% of total cultivated area in Poland. The Polish market for organic products is perceived as growing, although poorly functioning distribution chains are an obstacle for its development. Its characteristic feature is a significant dispersion and the mismatch between location of production and location of the market demand for organic food. There are many relatively small organic farms scattered across the country, often located in remote areas distant from the main organic food markets. Organic food consumers are located mainly in large cities, where both, the income level and the appreciation of organic food is greater. The chain of organic pasta under observation may be considered an Integrated Supply Chain co-ordinated by Babalski, President of the “Bio-Babalscy” company and at the same time an organic farmer. The chain is an example of the very successful integration process that was the outcome of a strong organizational and financial synergy. Cooperation within the chain is largely based on mutual trust and friendly relations between farmers (grain suppliers) and the processor. Farmers are suppliers of different, even ancient types of wheat (spelt, einkorn wheat, emmer wheat). In total over 400 tons of grains are being processed annually. The sales of final products totalled about 250 tons in the year 2016. About 60% of pasta and related products were sold to wholesalers and 32% to end consumers through the online shop. The remaining amount was sold directly to consumers from the farm shop (5%) and exported (3%), mainly to EU countries. As the reference, models of surveyed farms were constructed assuming the use of conventional farming methods. A conventional pasta producer was the reference for “Bio-Babalscy”. Sustainability indicators calculated for this case study show that: -the organic pasta chain appears to be more economically sustainable. All economic indicators are much higher at both the farm and processing stages of the chain.-environmental sustainability measured with the carbon footprint shows that the organic pasta chain is superior at the farm level, but the reference chain generates less greenhouse gas emissions if transportation is included in the system boundaries. The conventional pasta chain performs better for the Green Water footprint, however, Grey and Blue Water footprints are better in the organic pasta chain.- social sustainability cannot be estimated unambiguously, due to the diverse values of individual indicators. In absolute terms none of the chains can be defined as fully sustainable referring to estimated indicators. The organic pasta chain is socially slightly more sustainable according to the generational change indicator at the processing stage. There are no significant differences in values of gender equality. As for Bargaining Power the organic pasta supply chain can be considered more sustainable than the reference taking into account that power is much more evenly distributed than for the conventional chain. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={This study investigates the factors affecting the inter-organizational relationships and governance of firms in agri-food supply chains and assesses the influence that the current conditions of vertical coordination have on the economic performance of these firms. Research hypotheses describing the causal effects between the environment, product characteristics, inter-organizational relationships, relational governance, and firm economic performance are formulated and tested using a structural equation modeling approach. Data were gathered from a questionnaire administered via a direct survey to both farmers and processors in a traditional high-quality dairy sheep supply chain in the Italian region of Sardinia: the Pecorino Romano Protected Designation of Origin. Results point out the role of informal contractual arrangements in this local production system characterized by social cohesion, entailing higher product quality and better economic performance. Further, the study highlights the role of trust as a key variable for attaining collaborative paths along the agri-food supply chain, particularly between farmers and processors. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Food safety is a global public health issue, which often arises from asymmetric information between consumers and suppliers. With the development of information technology in human life, building a food traceability information sharing platform is viewed as one of the best ways to overcome the trust crisis and resolve the problem of information asymmetry in China. However, among the myriad information available from the food supply chain, there is a lack of knowledge on consumer preference. Based on the best-worst scaling approach, this paper investigated consumer preferences for vegetable, pork, and dairy product traceability information. Specifically, this paper measured the relative importance that consumers place on the traceable information. The results indicate that consumers have varying priorities for information in different cases. “Pesticide/veterinary use,” “picking/slaughtering date,” and “fertilizer/feed use” are the most preferred traceable information for Chinese consumers in the case of vegetables, while “picking/slaughtering date” and “history of illness and taking protective measures” are the most preferred information in the case of pork. In the case of dairy products, consumers prefer “processing information,” “environmental information of the origin,” and “traceable tag certification information” most. The results of this study call for the direct involvement of the Chinese government in the food safety information sharing system as following. First, given consumers’ diverse preferences, different types of traceable information should be recorded into the information sharing platform depending on food types. Second, the government could promote the step-by-step construction of such a platform based on the priority of consumers’ preferences. Third, new technology should be applied to guarantee the reliability of traceable information. Finally, local preferences in terms of the way consumers receive and understand information should be taken into consideration. © 2018 Liu et al.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate meat traceability by outlining the different perspectives and opinions of meat supply chain stakeholders (SCSs); it also evaluates potential of acceptance of blockchain technology (BCT) as a viable transparency and traceability system (TTS). Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey of 141 consumers reveals their opinions about TTSs. In addition, semi-structured interviews with seven retail managers, four government officials and one blockchain service provider (Project Provenance Ltd) provide expert insights. Findings: The results demonstrate that consumers are overwhelmed by the amount and complexity of certification labels. As a TTS, BCT implementation appears to have significant positive influences on consumers’ purchasing decisions, mediated by consumers’ quality perceptions. This study reveals the discordant perspectives of different stakeholders with regard to the importance of a BCT-based TTS. Originality/value: This study investigates current TTSs and certification labels, and probes customer perception of a potential BCT-based solution for meat traceability. Changes to supply chains’ mentality and the active establishment of trust in BCT applications are needed. Firms should take both holistic and altruistic views to deal with the challenges of TTSs in the meat supply chain. The adoption of BCT, in combination with DNA coding, seems promising as a solution to many of the issues that currently plague TTSs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Little is known about the value of sustainably-produced rice and incentive mechanisms for the adoption of sustainable production standards throughout rice value chains in Southeast Asia. This study tests the feasibility of a market-based incentive mechanism by eliciting consumers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice produced and labeled under a national sustainable production standard in the South of Vietnam through experimental auctions. Domestic consumers are willing to pay a 9% price premium for certified sustainably-produced rice. This premium gradually increases up to 33% when incremental levels of information on certification and traceability are provided. Consumers willing to pay premiums for sustainably-produced rice are more health-conscious, have better knowledge of and greater trust in food quality certification for rice, and tend to be more environmentally conscious and to read food labels before purchasing. Findings suggest that sustainable production labels for rice should be accompanied by supplementary information on certification and traceability to increase consumers’ awareness and appreciation of sustainably-produced rice. Promoting certified sustainably-produced rice hence crucially hinges on strengthening consumers’ knowledge of and trust in food quality certification. Communication strategies are recommended to focus on the environmental and health benefits of sustainably-produced rice. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Traditional approaches to the abstraction and treatment of water for public supply depend on a range of engineered approaches including dams, interbasin water transfers, and groundwater abstraction, generally with a high reliance on energy-and chemical-intensive treatment processes post abstraction. Substantial energy inputs, associated climate-active gas emissions, chemical inputs and linked supply chain concerns, waste generation including disruptive vehicle movements, and maintenance activities mean that the sustainability of this approach is questionable. These concerns are allied to the risks associated with declining water availability resulting from less predictable weather patterns. Overcoming these problems stemming from a largely reactive and piecemeal approach to water management, a more systematic and ecosystem-based approach is gaining momentum. This takes the form of a catchment-based approach, emphasizing the benefits of controlling contamination of water at source rather than committing greater retrospective investment in more intensive cleanup of water abstracted lower in catchments. This transition is driven largely by water quality considerations, though water quantity concerns are increasingly also influencing planning. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

abstract={Background/Aims Persistent incidents of food fraud in China have resulted in low levels of consumer trust in the authenticity and safety of food that is domestically produced. We examined the relationship between the concerns of Chinese consumers regarding food fraud, and the role that demonstrating authenticity may play in relieving those concerns. Methods A two-stage mixed method design research design was adopted. First, qualitative research (focus groups n = 7) was conducted in three Chinese cities, Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu to explore concerns held by Chinese consumers in relation to food fraud. A subsequent quantitative survey (n = 850) tested hypotheses derived from the qualitative research and theoretical literature regarding the relationship between attitudinal measures (including risk perceptions, social trust, and perceptions of benefit associated with demonstrating authenticity), and behavioral intention to purchase “authentic” European products using structural equation modelling. Results Chinese consumers perceive food fraud to be a hazard that represents a food safety risk. Food hazard concern was identified to be geographically influenced. Consumers in Chengdu (tier 2 city) possessed higher levels of hazard concern compared to consumers in Beijing and Guangzhou (tier 1). Structural trust (i.e. trust in actors and the governance of the food supply chain) was not a significant predictor of attitude and intention to purchase authenticated food products. Consumers were shown to have developed ‘risk-relieving’ strategies to compensate for the lack of trust in Chinese food and the dissonance experienced as a consequence of food fraud. Indexical and iconic authenticity cues provided by food manufacturers and regulators were important elements of product evaluations, although geographical differences in their perceived importance were observed. Conclusions Targeted communication of authenticity assurance measures, including; regulations; enforcement; product testing; and actions taken by industry may improve Chinese consumer trust in the domestic food supply chain and reduce consumer concerns regarding the food safety risks associated with food fraud. To support product differentiation and retain prestige, European food manufactures operating within the Chinese market should recognise regional disparities in consumer risk perceptions regarding food fraud and the importance of personal risk mitigation strategies adopted by Chinese consumers to support the identification of authentic products. © 2018 Kendall et al.

abstract={To better understand the success and the growing number of Short Food Supply Chains in Italy, this study investigates consumer motivations and behaviours with regard to these alternative agri-food networks through an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). In particular, the paper focuses on the role of consumer trust towards purchasing at short chains, as well as the role of consumer rural residence and fair-trade purchasing preference, in addition to common TPB variables. To this purpose, an online survey was conducted on a convenience sample of 260 consumers in Italy. Structural equation modelling confirmed the role of trust as a direct antecedent of consumer intention to purchase food at short chains, as well as the best-supported attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control in the standard TPB model. The investigation found that consumer rural residence and fair-trade purchasing habits, in addition to intention and perceived behavioural control, influenced the behaviour. This evidence is interesting in order to suggest further marketing strategies for farmers in the direction of more ethical and trust-related forms of consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Halal food industry has grown substantively worldwide in the last few years. It has become increasingly crucial to Muslim consumers due to its safety, hygiene and quality assurance. In Islam, Muslim consumers follow the Shariah and the food they consume should be halalan-thoyyiban, i.e. lawful or permissible, authentic, wholesome, and safe. In Malaysia, halal food manufacturers should comply with MS1500:2009 in order to obtain halal certification (halal logo). However, there is an increasing number of halal logo misuse cases and halal food's questionable status. In addition, any improper description and inappropriate preparation of halal food has significant impacts unto the demand for halal food and buyers' trust in consuming halal food. Hence, trust is an essential element in food production and it must be upheld along the halal food supply chain by all the parties involved. Given the significant role of trust in halal food production among Muslim consumers, this study aimed at examining the influence of halal practices integrity on halal supply chain trust and supply chain performance. Using a quantitative approach, survey questionnaires were distributed to 212 Malaysian halal food and beverages companies during halal food exhibitions and festivals. Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Square was used to analyze the collected data. The findings showed that halal practices integrity is significantly related to halal supply chain trust and supply chain performance. The results revealed that halal supply chain trust is significantly important in enhancing halal practices integrity and supply chain performance. The Malaysian government and various agencies in the halal industry should seriously take part in the development and promotion of halal food products to maintain consumer trust. The findings of this study would give some insights into the halal food supply chain integrity. © All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Recently, the concept of supply chain management has been applied in the food chains with the idea of transforming agribusiness through networking and trustful partnership in the food chains. In this regard, it is important to consider the empirical knowledge of the interface among the variables of factors in the supply chain governance structure choices, the chain actors' choice of governance models, and the effects of these on the supply chain performances. The aim of this study was to empirically verify the relationships between factors existing in the business scenarios, the chain actors' governance structure choice, and supply chain performances of dairy chains in Ethiopia. The chains were assessed using the survey data that were collected from 215 chain actors and analyzed using structural equation modelling and IBM SPSS and IBM AMOS of version 24 software. The data collected were tested for the Cronbach's alpha reliability test for the internal consistency and using the different model goodness of fit measure tests. The results showed that the transaction cost, trust, and uncertainty significantly (P < 0.001) predicted the chain actors' supply chain governance model choice. On the other hand, uncertainty, willingness to collaborate, and collaborations advantages explained trust significantly (P < 0.001). The correlations analysis among the factors showed that there existed negative significant correlation between transaction cost and willingness to collaborate. The correlation between willingness to collaborate and collaborative advantages was found positive and significant. Similarly, the correlation between uncertainty and transaction specific investments was found positive and significant. Moreover, chain actors' supply chain governance structure choice significantly explained the supply chain performances, such as efficiency, flexibility, level of dairy losses, and level of integrations in the dairy chains. Promoting established dairy chain governance system, either through dependable relational governances or through formal contractual structure has been found improving the performances of the studied dairy chains. © 2018 Amentae et al.},

abstract={Imperfect competition in the food supply chain is a concern for several “weak agents” such as small farmers and consumers. Given the difficulties in applying standard anti-trust regulations in the agrifood system, a growing interest is emerging in a decentralized approach where private entities, such as Producer Organizations (PO), are given active role in the governance of the agricultural markets. We present a simple bargaining model assessing the POs’ capacity to rebalance bargaining power along the supply chain. The results show that POs can benefit farmers by strengthening their negotiation power, improving their bargaining position and worsening the buyer’s one. Imposing a minimum size for POs may improve their effectiveness in affecting the buyer’s bargaining position. Such requirement should be calibrated on the structure of the downstream (upstream) relevant market. © 2018, Bononia University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article examines how effective quality assurance mechanisms can help address three challenges facing scaling-up efforts in supply chains for complementary foods in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): sourcing, market size and consumer trust. We use supply chain analysis to evaluate how stakeholder actions and relationships influence the dynamics of complementary food markets in SSA. We argue that effective signalling of credence attributes via credible quality assurance can contribute to the sustainability of local complementary food supply chains and once established, may contribute to the long-term affordability, accessibility and availability of these foods in SSA. The article concludes by stressing that allocating resources for establishing or further implementing regional and/or state-level quality assurance mechanisms for food safety and quality requires the coordination of stakeholder actions to address food insecurity across SSA. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={The U.K. food and grocery market is highly significant financially and dominated by 10 retailers within a regulated and extremely economically competitive environment. We summarize the approach of U.K. retailers to allergen risk assessment (RA) and risk management (RM) within the U.K. legal framework and explore public visibility of retailers’ allergen policies. RA and RM of allergens appear effective in curtailing retail-triggered severe food allergy reactions. However, allergen recalls remain high, precautionary allergen labeling (PAL) remains an area of confusion, and there is no consistent Web-based provision of information for consumers who have allergies. Resolution of PAL awaits an agreed-on threshold framework, but a key challenge is to engage with patients and gain their trust rather than thrust education at them. It would be helpful for retailers to publish their allergen RA and RM policies. A target should be agreed on between government and retailers for a reduction in the proliferation of PAL wording variants by a given date within the next 3 years. A further hurdle is potentially flawed allergen analysis—development of reference methods and reference materials are acknowledged needs. Laboratories should report allergen results in an informative manner, communicating uncertainty and caveats. Ideally a laboratory representative would be included on any incident control team. Efforts must continue to standardize preparedness for protecting and defending food and drink from deliberate attack. © 2018 AOAC International. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={This paper aims at making progress in the conceptualization and characterization of Territorial Short Food Supply Chains (TSFSCs). As an illustration, this characterization is applied in the city of Córdoba (Spain), through the use of Social Network Analysis techniques. Results show that TSFSCs are a form of collective action that enhance relational capital and territorial embeddedness. The linkage among alternative economies, the participation of small producers, and the construction of trust mechanisms are emphasized. Thus, changes in territorial food governance are manifested by the prevailing participation of civil society organizations in this type of initiatives. © 2018, Asociacion Interprofesional para el Desarrollo Agrario.

abstract={Food supply chains consist of many links and operate on a global scale with many stakeholders involved from farm to fork. Each stakeholder maintains data about food products that they handle, but this data is not transparently available to all stakeholders in the chain and trust in data sharing is low. In addition, there are various other data sources that contain interesting data for stakeholders in the food chain, such as import/export transactions, production (forecast) data, parcel crop information, local weather predictions and social media streams. To improve their production, growers and traders are very interested in trends in the market and activities in supply and demand. To make all stakeholders in the food chain benefit from these data sources and to share data more transparently, the Dutch horticulture and food domain is developing the HortiCube platform via which various data sources are made accessible to application developers using a secure, linked data application interface. This paper describes the design and engineering of the semantic approach to enable interoperability between data sources. This includes (1) a high-level design of the HortiCube, (2) the metadata ontology used for describing the contents of the data sources in the HortiCube, (3) the common horticulture model used to achieve semantic alignment between data sources in the HortiCube, (4) a test application for a specific product case and (5) a discussion of our results and future work on this topic. The main contribution of our research is the generic solution and ontology design to the semantic challenges that arise when different data sources are combined to answer analysis questions for the user.},

abstract={Buyer and seller relationship has been one of prominent issues of discussion especially in an emerging country's economy. In many ways, both parties interact with each other and over time will create long term relationships which may benefit them. This study focuses on the dynamic of trust between the fisherman (seller) and their buyer and the relationship of trust towards business performance. A total of 98 hook and line tuna fisherman in Mabul Island, Semporna were interviewed using guided-completion questionnaires. The data collected was tested using SmartPLS. The study reveals that communication was the strongest variable influencing trust followed by price satisfaction, interdependency and information sharing. On the same note, cultural similarities and flexibility were found non-significant towards trust. The study also found that trust has no direct influence towards business performance. From a managerial perspective, in order to be successful, channel members need to develop, maintain and seek improvements on communication, information sharing, interdependency and price satisfaction variables within the supply chain. It will be beneficial for members in the value chain to adopt the usage of information technology gadgets to boost communication and information sharing within the industry thus strengthening interdependency among members of the tuna fishing industry. From a theoretical perspective, the findings were consistent with previous researchers who also found that communication, information sharing, interdependency and price satisfaction variables were the main actors in the buyer-seller relationship context specifically on the trust dynamic. © 2008 IFRJ, Faculty of Food Science & Technology, UPM.},

abstract={We analyze the sustainable seafood movement as a maturing social-ecological issue. Using a timeline of events over more than a decade and other indicators of growth, we identified key points during its six developmental stages, and evidence of entrance into the final (Normative) phase. After distilling and evaluating the main criticisms and claims attributed to sustainable seafood initiatives globally, we concur that the movement has successfully cultivated a demand for solutions to the challenges of seafood sustainability by creating novel interactions along the value chain – even with the modest investment of our South African example. The global movement is best considered as a dynamic process with interplay at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and asynchronous phases of maturation. We recommend future investment in compliance, governance, credibility, and trust-building as key interventions to reduce risks of problem displacement, in support of a stable Normative phase across the seafood supply chain. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Issues related to foodborne contaminants and adulterants continue to raise concerns, eroding trust in the integrity of our food supply chains and / or manufacturing practices. Despite significant efforts to simplify supply chains, provide better visibility / transparency of food origin, as well as to improve agricultural practices, residual risks may remain that need to be mitigated. In this context, several advanced tools and technologies are highlighted in this volume, exploring for example the use of digital solutions in food safety, more effective verification measures at field or farm, up to sophisticated untargeted “omics” approaches to identify early events that may lead to non-compliance or even harm to the consumer. Verification and surveillance activities remain an important tool in ensuring safe foods, albeit progressing from classically “known risks” toward a risk- based approach. This comprehensive volume provides readers with an up-to-date status on selected foodborne contaminants and adulterants, additionally highlighting research trends and where relevant further needs to ensure the safety and integrity of our food supply chains. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The current study focuses on Malaysian retailers’ perception of and attitude toward organic certification. The primary purpose of food and organic certification is to provide greater information and certainty to consumers as to the origins and nature of food as well as to differentiate a product from others that do not fulfill certification requirements. In addition, food and organic certification may be important for retailers in strengthening their structural power in food retail and as a retail sustainability strategy that influences consumer behavior related to organic and related food products. The overwhelming majority of studies on food and organic certification focus on consumer and producer perception rather than the retailer, yet retailers contribute to consumer knowledge of, preferences for, and trust in, organic products, as well as the overall availability of organic foods in the food supply chain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={During the past decades, various technological applications relating to an extension of the shelf life of food products have been introduced. The adoption of such technologies in the fresh-cut salad sector is a key issue for the sustainable management of the supply chain. The aim of the study is to analyse consumers’ attitude towards fresh-cut salad with an extended shelf life date. The analysis was based on face-to-face interviews with 351 consumers living in Lombardy, one of the Italian provinces where the consumption of fresh-cut salad is high and characterized by good margins of development. Principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation was used as preliminary data preparation for market segmentation. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of three different consumers groups. Only the cluster of ‘favorable’ shows a positive attitude towards the extended shelf life date. Consumers grouped in the cluster of ‘skeptical’ associate such innovation to a low level of product freshness. The cluster of ‘mistrust’ reveals the presence of consumers with safety concerns towards the prolongation of the shelf life date. Such consumers do not reveal a high level of trust in processing firms and their related brands. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Misconduct in global meat supply chains are omnipresent and even more so in differentiated chains where credence attributes such as origin and taste are used to differentiate the product. By definition, these attributes signal asymmetric information which implies that in the presence of bounded rational individuals with conflicting interests, misconduct in the form of opportunistic behavior is bound to prevail. Increased information exchange through farmer networks is, however, expected to reduce opportunistic behavior. In the case of a differentiated meat product, such as Karoo Lamb, the article studies the farmer-abattoir transaction with the purpose of recommending strategies that can be implemented to reduce the farmer's tendency to behave opportunistically. The article employs the PLS approach to SEM and reveals a significant negative relationship between information shared and opportunistic behavior. The results indicate significant positive relationships between trust in the abattoir and information shared as well as between farmer networks and information shared. These results are indicative of the support provided to the information shared construct by higher levels of trust between farmers and abattoirs and established farmer networks. It is, therefore, recommended that differentiated meat supply chains, through their various associations, concentrate their efforts to promote information sharing by building stronger, trust centered relationships and by supporting farmer networks. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists},

abstract={The food donation process in Belgium is mapped and analyzed to identify bottlenecks in compliance with the legal framework and implementation of food safety management, based on literature search and interviews with stakeholders (donors, acceptors, regulators and facilitators) in Belgium and at EU level. The study revealed that the food donation/acceptation chain is far less structured and organized than the conventional food supply chain. The fragmented landscape of many small food banks and charity organizations (acceptors), often directed by and working with volunteers without training in food safety and lack of knowledge of legal food hygiene requirements is a bottleneck to generate trust among food donors and restricts the provision of perishable products in food donations. Lack of refrigerated transport and insufficient cold/freezing capacity in food banks and charity organizations was identified as a barrier to distribute perishable products. Furthermore, in two cities in Flanders (Belgium), at some food donation centers, donated perishable food samples (n = 72) were taken and subjected to microbiological analysis to determine their overall food quality, hygiene and food safety status. Twenty-two of 72 analyzed samples showed marginal microbiological quality based on numbers of yeast, lactic acid bacteria or total viable count. In three samples Listeria monocytogenes was detected per 25 g among which one ready-to-eat cooked meat product which showed increased numbers of L. monocytogenes (3.5 log CFU/g) and Enterobacteriaceae (6.7 log CFU/g). Overall, in Belgium, most of the donated foods considers nonperishable foods, with more or less half of the food collected by the food banks being purchased with funds from FEAD (Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived) and thus not derived from food losses. Efforts are being made by facilitators to provide a platform for better coordination of donors and acceptors to make more efficient use of food losses. Regulators at the national level are taking action to clarify and provide some flexibility in food hygiene regulation and initiatives on EU level to facilitate food donation in the combat of food losses are pending. As from the side of the acceptors, it is recommended to professionalize the acceptation chain in Belgium and seek for a more harmonized approach and concerted action. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In forest operations, the interface between forest companies and harvesting contractors is of special importance, considering that it is the first link in the forest industry's supply chains. Supply operations account for a significant share of the final costs of wood products (up to 50%). This study investigates the effect of customer-contractor alignment on contractors' profit margins and on the risk for business relationship breakdown. Alignment is empirically measured for a Swedish forest company and 74 of its harvesting contractors, who were monitored during a four-year period. Two measures of alignment are employed: (1) the customer-perceived value of the contractors' services; and (2) the contractors' perceived alignment with the forest company expectations. Results indicate that the two measures of alignment are largely independent from each other, and that customer-perceived value affects both contractor profitability and the risk of relationship breakdown. Conflict between the two parties and lack of trust for the customer were found to be common complaints among contractors who ceased working for the studied forest company. Consequently, customer-contractor alignment should be considered a key objective by contractors who strive for business success, and also by forest companies who wish to improve their supply chain performance. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Mature green tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Neang Pich) were exposed to 13.6 kJ m−2 UV-C or 0.5 μL L−1 1-MCP or combination of 13.6 kJ m−2 UV-C and 0.5 μL L−1 1-MCP, with appropriate untreated controls. After treatment, tomatoes were stored in air containing 0.1 μL L−1 ethylene at 20°C and 100% RH. The untreated fruit ripened significantly faster than those of all other treatments. UV-C treatment alone was able to delay fruit ripening by up to 5 days longer compared to untreated fruits whilst the additional of 1-MCP further delayed fruit ripening. UV-C and 1-MCP treatments alone or in combination had significantly slower ethylene production rates throughout the storage period. The fruit treated with the combination of 1-MCP and UV-C was significantly firmer and had higher total phenolic content compared to that of the other treatments. However, there was no difference between treatments in soluble solids content/titratable acids ratio, chlorophyll content, lycopene content and total antioxidant activity. These results show that UV-C and 1-MCP treatment delay ripening and improve the quality of tomatoes in the presence of low-level ethylene during storage.

abstract={Currently, the food safety incidents happened frequently in china and the customer confidence declined rapidly, then the problems related to food quality and safety have attracted more and more social attention. Considering the concern with regard to food quality assurance and consumer confidence improvement, many companies have developed a traceability system to visualize the supply chain and avoid food safety incidents. In this paper, we proposed an improved food traceability system which can not only achieve forward tracking and diverse tracing like the existing systems do, but also evaluate the food quality timely along the supply chain and provide consumers with these evaluating information, to mainly enhance the consumer experience and help firms gain the trust of consumers. For the food quality evaluation, the method of fuzzy classification was used to evaluate the food quality at each stages of supply chain while the artificial neural network was adopted to derive the final determination of the grade of food quality according to all the stage quality evaluations. A case study of a pork producer was conducted, and the results showed that the improved traceability system performed well in food quality assurance and evaluation. In addition, implications of the proposed approach were discussed, and suggestions for future work were outlined. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Especially in the food sector, fraud and counterfeiting are affecting the trust of consumers, who are more and more oriented to chose products basing on quality and traceability attributes rather than the price. Recently, the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard was introduced to provide specifications for the representation of product traceability information. The collection and analysis of such information allows supply chains to be monitored and controlled through virtualization. Several applications of EPCIS were presented in literature, even if most of them are mainly focused on enabling technologies, with less emphasis on assessing how the available information can be used for a control at a higher level. This chapter review the relevant literature available on this topic, and present an architecture allowing the traceability of information about products throughout the entire supply chain by exploiting both the EPCIS standard and a NoSQL database. An application showing the potentiality of the proposed system in a case study is also reported. © 2017, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the current era, food chains are becoming increasingly complex and consumer concerns about food safety are growing. As a result, consumers tend to rely heavily on chain actors to ensure the quality of the products they consume. Given this background, this study was conducted with a view to understanding the level of consumers' trust in vegetable supply chain members and how trust influences the consumers' behavioural responses. This paper is based on data obtained from 854 respondents in south-west Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The results revealed that the level of trust placed in chain members varied across the chain. Respondents considered that domestic producers are more trustworthy in terms of producing safer vegetables and the lowest trust level was associated with imported vegetables. Gender, household size, years of stay in Australia, trust perceptions, and country of origin concerns had a significant influence on the respondents’ intentions to pay a premium price for domestically produced vegetables. The study revealed that consumers respond to food safety concerns and this creates an opportunity for the vegetable industry to respond to these concerns. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The dairy sector in Tunisia is suffering from a lack of coordination and cooperation between the stakeholders. This study suggests cooperatives as a solution to better manage the supply chain. The analysis is based on the social networking paradigm to understand the structure and conduct of the dairy value chain with a focus on trust as key determinant of coordination between stakeholders. Two groups in one region and with different institutional arrangements were investigated. One group is composed of stakeholders organized into a cooperative, while the second was composed of unorganized stakeholders. Using a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) approach we find evidence that cooperatives help stakeholders build trust, be better connected and reduce conflicts and problems among actors in the dairy value chain. © 2017, Fundacion CIPAV.

abstract={Growth in organic food sales is mainly due to consumers becoming more aware of health issues and environmental concerns. Understanding the drivers of organic consumption is crucial to predict future market outcomes. In this analysis, the authors expand previous research by including general and institutional trust variables in addition to consumer attitudes to examine organic food purchases. Food production is unobservable and hence, consumers need to exhibit trust with respect to organic production and certification. A bivariate ordered probit model applied to U.S. survey data confirms that organic purchases are determined by health, nutrition, and taste. In some cases, general trust and trust in media are statistically significant. Trust in institutions that are involved in the organic certification process is not statistically significant. A hierarchical cluster analysis grouping consumers based on trust and attitudes shows that (dis)trust in the organic certification and supply chain does not hinder organic food market growth. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure and evaluate the relationship between collaborative communication, power dependence, price satisfaction, trust, supplier loyalty, and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings: The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications: It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications: The research confirms that individual dairy farmer’s loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value: Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The flow of the Sino-Brazilian frozen beef trade has intensified. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to characterize the supply chain structure, and identify its major fragilities. Design/methodology/approach: Supply chain mapping was conducted based on the existing literature and primary data collection. Key stakeholders were detected and questioned through semi-structured interviews, which were later interpreted with content analysis. Findings: The results reveal a low degree of chain coordination from the Brazilian farm to the Chinese consumer, arising from an immature traceability mechanism, a limited flow of reliable information between the segments, and low trust between the stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The infancy of the beef trade, the paucity of literature on the topic, and restricted accessibility to key governmental and official materials imposes limits on the available information. Language and cultural barriers might have also impacted the interviewees’ responses. However, the participation of Brazilian and Chinese academics in both the interview analysis and chain mapping mitigates these shortcomings. Practical implications: The Brazilian public and private sectors need to establish a reliable traceability system and information platform. This, together with investments in marketing and branding, would facilitate differential responses among traders and consumers, and, hence, improve supply chain sustainability. Originality/value: By adopting an inter-country approach and directly sourcing views from specific key figures in the supply chain this study offers some unique insights and contributes to the literature on the emergence of a multi-polar global food trade. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Local production supports the economies of place and increasingly makes sense as the citizen-consumers increase in number and awareness. Nonetheless, despite the value of the short supply chains, some researchers have reacted sceptically to the irrational optimism around this sales structure. A close relationship with consumers does not imply more profi t or exchange fairness by defi nition. In fact, increasing marketing costs must be considered and there is still information asymmetry, and the profi teering farmers could take advantage of the consumer trust. Th rough data reduction we explored the farmers' motivation and perceived eff ects of participating in short food supply chains. We also analysed the location of farms along with their size, production, sale channels and the relative market share, as well as whether they adopted quality certifi cations. We found that the farmers that work within the short food supply chains opt for a sort of co-certifi cation mechanism based on the consumer/producer relationships rather than opting for the quality certifi cation. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed diff erent motivations and perceptions of direct sales among farmers: those that were the largest and farthest from the point of sale, were positive toward the social values of short food supply chains, while the rest seemed less competitive and were more motivated by profi t and survival. Th e results reaffi rm that the local production may not be good per se, and the presence of profi t and surviving-orientation to market should be considered a treat especially for the reputation of the whole system. © 2017, Agricultural Economics.

abstract={In the current paper we study producer-consumer linkages in a small rural market in Mexico. Two short food supply chains for the sale of egg were identified, which reduced producer-consumer distance and enabled the exchange of information regarding egg origin, egg production practices, and egg characteristics valued by consumers. This allowed the creation of food symbolism and increased consumers’ knowledge and trust in small-scale producers and their products. It is concluded that producer-consumer linkages in short chains enable closeness, confidence, and exchange of information between them. © 2017, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

abstract={A traceability system is an effective tool to guarantee safety in horticultural products and to improve supply chain transparency. A direct data matrix (DM) code created with carbon dioxide laser (wavelength 10.6 μm) can be used as a trust mark on bananas. In this study, green bananas were marked with the above-mentioned CO2 laser. Subsequently, the samples were held under storage conditions. Images of the codes on bananas were captured by using two different cameras; i.e. hyperspectral imaging camera and charge-couple device (CCD) camera. Image processing was used for evaluating print quality of 2D codes based on the ISO/IEC 15415 standard. The quality of the codes on bananas mainly depends on some parameters: laser power, laser energy, marking time per module and storage time. The best readability results were achieved by using laser power of 1.8 W and marking time of 0.09 s per data matrix module, whereby an 80-100% readability of DM codes after the storage was obtained.},

abstract={Economic theory considers physical production characteristics and related property rights as key determinants of the organization of an industry. Yet, we frequently observe coexisting governance modes within industries and firms, even when the transaction attributes of a commodity are homogenous. We test whether risk and time preferences, price expectations, and trust in supply chain types can explain variations and coexistence in governance. Specifically, we experimentally elicit economic preferences of forest managers in the Swiss wood sector. We find that all behavioral dimensions are related to the choice of sales channel. Most importantly, trust and expectations are key determinants in transferring property rights, while risk aversion, patience, and ownership structure explain the existence of plural forms at the firm level. © 2016 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå},

abstract={Vertical chain collaboration is a strategy for customers' value creation. However, Dutch fishermen are hardly participating in integrated value chains. While supply chain literature describes factors that contribute to successful chain partnerships, scarce research has been done on the dynamics of the sociocultural context for chain collaboration. In 10 semi-structured interviews, representatives of supply chain parties were asked for their perceptions on chain collaboration, trust, and the role of the local community. The interviews were directed at obtaining so-called 'tacit' knowledge, the non-spoken codified truths of social networks. Without generalizing, this research provides benchmarks to monitor how the different domains, laid out in this study, impact chain collaboration: community values, network participation and company competences. An overview is given of socio-economic factors blocking and enhancing chain collaboration at company and community level. Factors such as the strong bonding of family with business in tightly knit networks, a high level of social control, entrepreneurial autonomy, and loyalty as community norm hamper collaboration within the supply chain.Respondents' discourse demonstrates that cultural codes and identity form the very core of the entrepreneur, driving rather than 'embedding' economic behavior. Kinship, religion and peer pressure determine 'windows on the world' when engaging in chain collaboration. Consequently, any analysis of economics that does not integrate sociological and psychological methodology is flawed from the outset. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Consumers and other stakeholders expect ethical business practices along the supply chain, making it imperative for business customers to have a 'responsibility centred' purchasing strategy. This paper analyses the influence of perception of responsibility and ethics by focussing on "fairness" within supply chain relationships. The research employs a multiple case study approach to analyse the relationship between fair and equitable business conduction and dyadic supply chain relationships from a business customer's (retailer's) perspective. The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with an intent to determine fairness related factors that affect purchasing and vertical inter-organizational relationships. The results illustrate that within the organic fresh fruit and vegetable value chain, the vertical relationships between suppliers and business customers are heavily influenced by the perception of fairness and responsibility centric activities of the supplier organization. A major finding of fairness perception is that from a business customer's perspective, fairness perception is possible only when there is a fair behaviour to all stakeholders and thereby, the paper defines fairness from a stakeholder perspective. Moreover, by dividing fairness into three components; distributive, procedural and interactive fairness, the paper illustrates that there is a difference in perceived fairness according to the focus on each component of fairness. With greater competition from both local and international suppliers, it is imperative that suppliers create and implement strategies that foster effective supply chain relationships and this research guides managers to achieve the same. Research analysing the interrelationships between the fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain actors' fairness perception and stakeholder orientation, and propensity to repurchase within a business-to-business context is minimal and this paper contributes to this scant literature.},

abstract={Postharvest losses in tomato are a major problem in the market supply chain of small farm holders in India. Spray drying is an effective postharvest technology used for making fruit powders with long shelf life. The spray drying behaviour of different tomato cultivars and tamarillo was studied with continuous observation of parameters like feed flow rate, setting of inlet and outlet temperature and addition of malt dextrin using a commercial scale spray drier located in Gandhigram trust under a public-private-partnership mode study linked with Aruna Agro Agencies Ltd. Theni. Tomatoes were collected from growers of Oddanchatram (Indam-Ruchi), Dindigul (Co- 3) and Theni (PKM-1) and tamarillo (Red) and (Yellow) from Kodaikanal growers were used. With the feed rate of 80 mL min-1 in to the atomizer, addition of 40 g malt dextrin in 1 L pulp, controlled by a peristaltic pump, inlet air temperatures of 160°C for tomato and 164°C for tamarillo at a constant outlet temperature of 90°C were observed as the optimum conditions for the maximum recovery of tomato and tamarillo fruit powders.},

abstract={Purpose – A good supply chain relationship quality (RQ) is a crucial precursor for any stable exchange relationship which ensures relationship continuity. Although empirical research suggests that strengthening RQ improves supply chain performance (SCP), most studies have focused on dyadic business relationships. To fully understand the relational behaviour of a firm embedded in a supply chain, we need to look beyond the dyad into triads. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how SCP is influenced by RQ in a triadic agribusiness supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is drawn from a quantitative survey of 150 agribusiness firms in the maize supply chain in Uganda. Data were collected in triadic context from 50 direct supply chains each composing of a supplier, focal firm and customer. Multi-group structural equations modelling (SEM) was used to assess the differences in perception on the influence of RQ on SCP amongst the supply chain members. Findings – Results provides empirical support for the positive influence of RQ on SCP. SEM reveals differences in perception between the upstream and downstream and amongst the supply chains members. While focal firms considered conflict, coercive power, commitment and trust to be important; suppliers considered trust, dependency and non-coercive power; and customers considered trust, dependency and coercive power to be important RQ factors affecting SCP. Practical implications – For agribusiness managers to enhance business performance there is need to cultivate strong and mutual relationship with supply chain members. It is also important to know how to handle conflicts and use of power so as to realise the benefits of supply chain relationships. Originality/value – The paper is novel in that it assesses SCP in a triadic context in an agribusiness sector from a developing country context. The authors used novel approaches including analysis of a triad, and multiple groups SEM to assess perceptions of each supply chain member’s. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose – Market transactions in large vegetable markets call for transparency with utmost urgency. The reason are that buyers are located at distant places and the volume of sales is very high. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the development of an automated system in market transactions in order to bring about transparency with concrete evidence available to small and medium farmers who are then able to repose trust in the system by acquiring the right price for the right product. The farmers can also confirm the effectiveness of the system by testing it themselves. Design/methodology/approach – First, a theoretical framework of marketing procedures of larger vegetable markets has been constructed with tomato as a vegetable of study and the Madanapalle tomato market as a market studied through surveys. Second, methods of functioning in marketing procedures including pricing and auctioning have been modified according to the objective. An android-based application has been used to develop an automated model. Surveys have been conducted to understand the perceptions of farmers in marketing procedures and price determination at the village level, and to test the automated model in the study market. Findings – Both quantitative as well as qualitative approaches indicate that, the proposed automated model in the modified marketing procedural system is of benefit to all stakeholders in the supply chain. Research limitations/implications – In model testing, gaps in inputs from a greater number of buyers during auctioning remains a limitation of the study. Social implications – For sustainable growth of tomatoes or any other vegetables it is essential that the farmers trust the marketing procedural system. This is possible if farmers obtain the right price for their products. Once the automated system is implemented, buyers acquire high-quality goods at desired prices, which further encourages more buyers from other regions to participate in the auctioning/tendering process stimulating an increased demand. Originality/value – This paper is unique in its pricing function and scores of stakeholders. Pricing function involves the farmers’ input along with the buyers’ inputs whereas scores of these two stakeholders have been obtained through the inputs of commissioning agents. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to understand the process and role of supply chain collaboration in Indian agri-food industry and highlight the perceptions of buyers and suppliers toward each other. The paper seeks to find out how can collaboration in agri-food supply chain lead to low wastage and better efficiency. Also, the paper attempts to capture the nuances of collaborative practices and perceptions of buyers and suppliers toward collaboration. Design/methodology/approach – Case study methodology in a top Indian food processing firm was conducted to explore the application and benefits of collaboration in supply chains. In-depth interviews with upstream supply chain members were conducted to understand the process of supply chain collaboration. Grounded theory methodology was used to analyze the transcripts. Findings – First, through content analysis of interview transcripts a comprehensive framework and a generic model was derived to understand the process of supply chain collaboration. Supplier selection, joint planning and information sharing were found to be main antecedents while profits; waste reduction and supply chain efficiency were major outcomes of collaboration. Second, it was found that the suppliers are usually more skeptical of the buyers and do not trust them easily. While, for buyers, it is very important to have good relations with suppliers and should make provide incentives to suppliers for collaboration. Originality/value – To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study to elaborate the process and outcomes of collaborative activities along an Indian agri-food supply chain through in-depth qualitative study. In developing countries, agriculture industry is the backbone of economy. Therefore, the insights developed in this study may be useful for managers in agribusiness to dwell into such supply chain practices that would increase profit and efficiency, and decrease wastage. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate which dimensions of price satisfaction influence producers’ trust in buyers and assess the mediating role of such trust in the relationship between price satisfaction and producer loyalty in fresh fruit supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – A cross-sectional study design using both semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires was used. The study was conducted in the Eastern part of Kenya and included 600 smallholders. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings – The results show that price fairness, price reliability, and relative price are dimensions of price satisfaction that affect producers’ trust in the buyer. Moreover, trust between the producer and the buyer is found to be a strong mediator between price satisfaction and producer loyalty. The findings support recent studies about trust and its mediating role. Research limitations/implications – The paper is based on a cross-sectional study design, limiting the causal inferences which can be drawn. Producers’ preferences change with time and future studies should be based on longitudinal designs. Originality/value – This paper shows the relationship between the multi-dimensional nature of price satisfaction and producer loyalty with trust as a mediating variable in the business-to-business (B2B) context. Although B2B relationships have been shown to be of great importance for smallholders in enhancing business performance with their buyers, little attention has been given to the role of trust as a mediator. This study offers interesting insights into the how trust plays a mediating role between price satisfaction and loyalty in a developing country context. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

It identified the factors influencing consumers' behaviors on vegetable purchase, safety and information channel with different demographic groups of consumers. A total 590 of valid questionnaires were collected in this study in January, 2015. The participants of 352 female and 238 male were consumers shopping at the supermarkets in Beijing urban areas. Results indicated that consumers intended to choose their trusted purchasing places to purchase vegetables, and their perceptions of "freshness" (m = 4.61, sd. = 0.78) and "pesticide residues" (m = 4.57, sd. = 0.95) were the top concerns. Female and senior consumers were more concerned about vegetable safety. Consumers who purchase vegetables frequently were more likely to pay attention to food safety and quality than the ones who have never brought vegetables. Consumers used different information channels to get vegetable knowledge. Most consumers used traditional information channels such as TV and broadcasting, while young and well-educated consumers relied more on internet. The findings suggested that some safety control measures need to be taken through the vegetable supply chain to reduce the hazards and ensure vegetable safety, which would help to establish or rebuild consumers' trusts on vegetable safety. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={With the advent of globalization, and the corresponding decrease in the number of barriers to international commerce, trade in the food industry spanned national and international boundaries. This phenomenal development has resulted in a plethora of food related contamination scandals. With the increasing complexity within the supply chain networks, it is imperative that all actors within the food supply chain operate in an ethical and sustainable manner and this paper illustrates a process model that will effectively bolster the ethical underpinning of a fresh produce supply chain. This paper evinces a structural conceptual model that facilitates the integration of responsibility within the operations of the organizations, within a fruit and vegetable supply chain. It also conceptualises a seven-tiered sequential model, the Vision to Innovation model (The V2I model) of responsibility, which has its foundation based on the congruence of the ethics related values, and Values consonance along its supply chain actors. The second element involves Communication among the supply chain elements; the successive elements include Implementation of ethical standards along the supply chain, the Monitoring systems, Control systems, Collaboration and finally, Innovation. This model accounts for responsibility-centricity along the entire supply chain and the implementation of this model, within the practical business world, would render an ethical climate for the industry. The authors postulate that this will positively influence the T's of fresh produce supply chains, namely: Traceability, Testability, Transparency, Trust and Time. Currently minimal research on social responsibility and sustainability within the supply chain context is present and this paper contributes to such a gap in literature.},

abstract={The private sector plays the most important role in financing agricultural investments, innovation and information dissemination where constraints on government investment render private sector actions more important. In East Africa, little is known about the participation of small businesses, independent traders, farmer organizations, large-scale wholesalers, marketing boards and cooperatives in climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and their potential role in its diffusion to small-scale farmers. In particular, the informal sector is out of view even though it forms the backbone of rural agrarian economies. This study examines relationships between private sector actors and farmers and examines supply chains of agricultural inputs, as well as agricultural product value chains. The potential for using the Quality Declared Seed (QDS) system to disseminate CSA bean and potato varieties is assessed, as is the commercial maize seed supply chain and its impact on agrobiodiversity. Finally, farmer trust of private sector actors, traders in particular, is evaluated. The data used is from a survey of 100 farmers and semi-structured interviews with traders, local input suppliers, transporters and marketing organizations. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={This research identifies what attracts suppliers to be committed to long-term relationships in New Zealand agri-food supply chains where suppliers are required to consistently deliver to high product specifications. It also looks at what factors determine supplier’s ongoing commitment and how to build strong enduring supply chain relationships. Semi structured interviews were undertaken with suppliers from New Zealand agri-food exporting companies. The main factors that attracted suppliers to these supply chains were; increased price certainty, premium prices and relationship quality. Many suppliers wanted to break away from the agricultural commodity cycle, which they saw as disconnected from customer demand, and characterised by price volatility. They saw themselves as better than average producers with the ability to produce high quality products. They valued the relationship with the companies they supplied as this gave them access to premium markets where they felt they would be rewarded for their effort. There was a high level of trust in these relationships and this was built on openness and transparency in communications and confidence in the character of the company personnel. The success of differentiated agri-food supply chains requires capable and committed suppliers. Companies that are developing a differentiated strategy need to identify suppliers who have the ability to produce high quality products and want to be involved in a customer focused supply chain enables them to access to premium markets. © 2015, Lees and Nuthall; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Background: Substandard drugs have long been a major human health problem in developing countries, and similar issues also beset the veterinary drug industry. Although less immediately costly to human life, the failure of veterinary treatment can be devastating for pastoralist livelihoods. Research on this problem has tended to be scientific, focussing on the prevalence and potential consequences of poor-quality products. In contrast, the social processes by which such products are traded and used have received far less scholarly attention. This study takes the case of animal African trypanosomiasis, one of Africa's most important cattle diseases, and uses interviews and focus groups to follow drugs as they pass through the supply chain from importers and distributors to vendors and customers. Results: Each set of actors uses different strategies to mitigate the risks of substandard drugs. For instance, pastoralists experiment carefully with suspect products before using them across their herds, whilst drug vendors and cattle owners try to invest in relationships with one another. These efforts of building reputation and trust, however, are hampered by the elusive nature of substandard drugs. Drug quality is impossible to gauge visually, and the treatment failure that substandard drugs can produce also has other causes, confusing the issue. Conclusion: Nigerian regulators are beginning to address this problem. A keen understanding of the strengths (efficiency and reach into rural areas) and weaknesses (difficulties in identifying fake and substandard products) of the veterinary drug marketplace should underpin their response to this issue. © 2015, Kingsley; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Background Community participation is a major principle of people centered health systems, with considerable research highlighting its intrinsic value and strategic importance. Existing reviews largely focus on the effectiveness of community participation with less attention to how community participation is supported in health systems intervention research. Objective To explore the extent, nature and quality of community participation in health systems intervention research in low- and middle-income countries. Methodology We searched for peer-reviewed, English language literature published between January 2000 and May 2012 through four electronic databases. Search terms combined the concepts of community, capability/participation, health systems research and low- and middleincome countries. The initial search yielded 3,092 articles, of which 260 articles with more than nominal community participation were identified and included.We further excluded 104 articles due to lower levels of community participation across the research cycle and poor description of the process of community participation. Out of the remaining 160 articles with rich community participation, we further examined 64 articles focused on service delivery and governance within health systems research. Results Most articles were led by authors in high income countries and many did not consistently list critical aspects of study quality. Articles were most likely to describe community participation in health promotion interventions (78%, 202/260), even though they were less participatory than other health systems areas. Community involvement in governance and supply chain management was less common (12%, 30/260 and 9%, 24/260 respectively), but more participatory. Articles cut across all health conditions and varied by scale and duration, with those that were implemented at national scale or over more than five years being mainstreamed by government. Most articles detailed improvements in service availability, accessibility and acceptability, with fewer efforts focused on quality, and few designs able to measure impact on health outcomes. With regards to participation, most articles supported community's in implementing interventions (95%, n = 247/260), in contrast to involving communities in identifying and defining problems (18%, n = 46/260). Many articles did not discuss who in communities participated, with just over a half of the articles disaggregating any information by sex. Articles were largely under theorized, and only five mentioned power or control. Majority of the articles (57/64) described community participation processes as being collaborative with fewer describing either community mobilization or community empowerment. Intrinsic individual motivations, community-level trust, strong external linkages, and supportive institutional processes facilitated community participation, while lack of training, interest and information, along with weak financial sustainability were challenges. Supportive contextual factors included decentralization reforms and engagement with social movements. © 2015 George et al.

abstract={The influence of ethics in business has been widely researched for decades, albeit from an end-consumer perspective. This research employs a systematic review of literature and a case study methodology to analyse the influence of ethical business on supply chain relationships within the fresh organic produce industry in the state of Victoria, Australia. By exploring the different ethical antecedents of interorganizational trust within supply chain relationships, such as purchase characteristics, reputation, ethos and fairness, the paper demonstrates the impact of responsibility in supply chain relationships. The conceptual framework was validated by examining four case studies of small retail organizations in the organic fresh produce supply chain in Australia. This research contributes to existing literature by elucidating the influence of ethics in all facets of supply chain relationship management.},

abstract={Purpose – A suitable leadership approach and multiple dimensions of performance (operational and social dimensions contributing to financial performance – the effectiveness of international agri-food supply chain coordination) are important because of significant linkages between them. However, there has been no such empirical research to explore the linkages in five selected New Zealand-UK international agri-food supply chains (dairy, meat, apples, onions and wine). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to address this knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach – Before applying covariance-based structural equation modelling (a path analysis) on the data collected from 112 chain coordinators (CCs) (chief executive officers, managing directors and head of departments) of the selected agri-food supply chains, a comprehensive process of exploratory factor analysis, reliability and validity tests is used to develop the constructs. Findings – The findings suggest that CCs’ participative leadership approach is highly significantly (β=0.60; p=0.00) associated with the effectiveness of international agri-food supply chain coordination. Directive leadership does not have a significant relationship and its interaction effect with participative leadership resulted in a significant negative relationship with the effectiveness of agri-food supply chain coordination. Moreover, social (satisfaction with and trust in supply chain partners) and operational (service and product quality) dimensions are the major determinants of financial performance (profit, sales and market share) with β=0.44 (p=0.00) and β=0.44 (p=0.05), respectively. These variables jointly explain 70 per cent of the variance in financial performance, and leadership explains 36 per cent of the variance in coordination effectiveness. Practical implications – In order to understand the multiple dimensions of performance and their linkages, the study enhances the understanding of CCs and contributes to determine the best practices for modern agri-food supply chains. Originality/value – This study is the first step in developing and confirming complicated linkages with the specific characteristics of selected international agri-food supply chains. As a result, the empirical evidence also clarifies the earlier ambiguous results on the topic raised from other industries or countries. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Food issues as increased prices and prices volatility, resources scarcity and climate change, are more and more emerging in today's fast moving global marketplace. In this scenario, understanding the dynamics of the agri-food chain is a crucial driver in order to tackle rapid and fast-spreading challenges related to the food products and their knowledge. Moreover, an increasing distance between production and consumption determined the need of acquiring knowledge and others determinants on food products. Nevertheless it is important to underline the relation between food ethics and innovation process (new technologies to production or management practices) whether the latter helps and boosts the development of the agro-food supply chain. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the link between food and ethics under several perspectives in the supply chain in order to understand how ethical issues may be traced to the analysis the agro food supply chain and how innovative food processes assess potential effects on the agri-food stakeholders. Agricultural ethics was being envisioned as an interdisciplinary sub-discipline that nowadays should become a significant basis to analyze norms and values being implicitly assumed by agricultural researchers, practitioners and policy makers assessing ethical and societal values equal to the economic concerns of production and consumption. Several works and policies are on the role of ethics including health, quality, trust, environmental welfare aspects in influencing consumer behaviour. Making use of a qualitative survey administrated to main actors involved in a supply chain the ethics approach is analyzed in food choices along the agri-food supply, whether consumer rely on trust and labeling practices, or whether producer foster the participation in innovation process and spread knowledge along the chain. Results corroborate the importance to build a fair and healthy food system for people and the environment. The paper is structured as follows: after a literature review on food and ethics, the present situation is described, especially ethical aspects, of the supply chain of wine in Apulia region in Southern Italy. Then, methodology is presented; an exploratory survey is carried out on two main steps of a supply chain: producers and consumers. Findings highlight that consumers choices are affected by some ethical motivation and also that wine producers increasingly shifted attention on sustainable practices and innovative methods to meet ethical issues. Finally conclusions are drawn.},

abstract={The introduction of new generation agricultural products has generated an increased need for efficient and accurate product segregation across a number of Canadian agricultural sectors. As a key component of wheat handling in the Canadian grain industry, grading of wheat for value-added blending has historically been accomplished by visual identification. As of 2008 in Canada, visual identification was eliminated for all primary classes of wheat and replaced by an alternative system of wheat declaration. Given the high costs of testing each truck and railcar for quality assurance, the declaration system must rely on incentives and trust as there is now considerable potential for accidental or opportunistic misrepresentation throughout the grain supply chain. This research attempts to identify cost-effective handling strategies and policies so as to maintain the integrity of the supply chain under the new declaration system. An agent-based simulation model is developed to capture the effects of individual heterogeneity as well as behavioral adaption to the declaration system within the modern wheat supply chain. The simulated results are used to identify superior testing strategies for handlers, along with the relative risks and costs associated with each of the testing strategies. © 2014 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.},

abstract={In recent years new forms of food distribution organisation, known as short supply chains, have gained ground. The local nature of such distribution has positive effects on the environment and on the local economy. Consumers appear to trust the short supply chain, and it has achieved considerable success. However, the short supply chain has credence characteristics which, by their very nature, cannot be identified through a system of certification. The question we address in this paper is whether it is possible to identify the constituent elements of the credence trait in relation to food quality in the short supply chain. Our hypothesis is that the latter are linked to a range of socially constructed food quality criteria. To develop a more inclusive vision of how such criteria are coordinated in food quality assessment by consumers, use has been made of convention theory. In accordance with convention theory, quality is identified, in a social context and informally, as one of the spheres in which economic activity is regulated by procedures which go beyond regulation by price. The aim of our study was to measure the effects of coordinated conventions of quality in the context of one type of short supply chain: farmers' markets specialised in the sale of organic products. An ordered logit model was implemented. Our results allow credence characteristics to be classified within conventions of quality and could help support strategies aimed at spreading sustainable forms of food distribution and consumption. Future research might go to the direction of validating our results based on a single form of supply organisation. Moreover, additional efforts should be made understanding the effect of situational factors on socio-demographic variables such as gender. Finally, an attempt should be made to merge different theories to better understand the issue of consumer choice. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Rapid population growth and income increase in countries across the world resulted in rising demand for quality and diverse food. Trade liberalisation and modernisation of production, processing and distribution systems enable agro-food companies to quickly access raw materials directly from farmers. However, the threats of exclusion and unbalanced benefit allocation from high-value markets represent the challenges for vulnerable small farmers affected by the transformation of food industry. The re-emerging contract farming tends to balance market imperfections and include small farmers into modern food chains. This research looks at the supply chain dynamics of paprika sector in Malawi Central region with the purpose to identify key challenges its players face, and propose changes to improve supply chain efficiency. Paprika supply chain was explored using mixed method approach: 428 household questionnaires and eight focus group discussions with small farmers, and five key informant semi-structured interviews with the company and enabling environment representatives. The data were triangulated and analysed using SPSS and NVivo. The result shows that paprika supply chain consists of direct players (farmers and company) and indirect players with significant role in building chain's efficiency (agro-dealers, NGOs, civil societies, Government, financing institutions, vendors). Additionally, for small farmers efficiency implies secured inputs and highest possible selling price. For the company, efficiency is related to minimised transaction costs and obtained planned volumes of appropriate quality. The research finds that communication quality and consistency, together with the trust level among players influence paprika supply chain efficiency. Moreover, the lack of understanding and complying with the contract terms hinders effective performance. The failure to define selling prices in the contract encourages farmers' opportunistic behaviour, e.g. side-selling. The study concludes that companies can increase farmer's loyalty by awarding long-term value through input bonuses, renting equipment and transportation, or subsidising the purchase of mobile devices and applications. © Wageningen Academic Publishers 2015.},

abstract={Consumers' decisions are increasingly influenced by ethical issues. In the food domain it has led to the spread of alternative food supply chains. These innovative food networks, deaply embedded in the local domain, are characterized by a strong focus on food sustainability. Among them, the initiatives promoted and selforganized by consumers are particularly interesting as they disclose a high potential of fostering wider social changes. In this context, Solidarity Purchase Groups (called gas after the Italian acronym) emerge as spontaneous associations of consumers with strong ethical motivations including environmental, economic and social issues, which are fast-spreading in Italy. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, looking at consumers, we analyze the profile of the Italian consumers who participate to gass, in order to more precisely identify the target of these experiences, on the base of a large survey held in Italy on short food chain consumers; on the other hand, from a strategic and operational level, we discuss how these innovative supply chain models are organized, drawing from data retrieved for the 117 gas s operating in the city of Rome. The results show that gas participants have some specific features compared to consumers shopping in other alternative food chains, both in the socio-demographic profile and in their purchasing behavior, which is characterized by a strong ethical motivation. Looking at the organizational models of the gas s of Rome, the results of the survey confirm that the social dimension is very important in the management of these groups, as well as the principles at the base of their constitution, which very often refer to environmental concerns about farming techniques, social commitment to the local community and trust-based relations with the producers. Nevertheless, beside the social and environmental concerns, the economic dimension is still very important, as shared purchases most of the time results in a significant reduction in prices. The evidences confirm that the gas model represents a very interesting object of analysis for economists. Indeed, gas s are an unique example of completely demand-pull innovative food chain. Besides, they are able to involve consumers with specific needs and a strong ethical motivation underpinning the food purchase. Copyright © FrancoAngeli.},

abstract={Purchasing local products has become a popular trend both in Latvia and in the world; yet, no single definition is available regarding what may be regarded as local products. The term local product is interpreted based on the distance between the producer and the consumer, administrative and political theories, social factors and personal opinions. Food systems refer to a full cycle from production to sales, whereas local food systems, which are regarded as an alternative to the global food system, are characterised by a short distance between the producer and the consumer, which increases mutual trust between the parties engaged. Besides, it has been found that local food systems are considered sustainable and local communities benefit from them economically, environmentally and socially. Local products are sold through traditional channels - food products are marketed through wholesale and retail networks - and through those popularising local products - short supply chains and direct sale channels -when products are purchased directly from the producer. The present research gives a summary and a short description of such sale channels. An essential role in increasing the sales of local products is also played by the public sector, as local products are purchased through municipal public food procurements. Even though the EU legislation stipulates that municipal public procurements may not require bidders to supply only local products because it contradicts the principles of free trade in the EU, yet, food products produced in the local region are preferred if sustainability criteria are integrated in procurement requirements.},

abstract={Attitudes towards beef animal welfare (AW) and Willingness to Pay (WTP) for AW certification are investigated among consumers in two Spanish and two French regions located on both sides of the Pyrenees (n=1213). Attitudes were measured through a scale of 11 animal practices, on which, consumers report their degree of concern and trust on the supply chain compliance. Attitudes significantly differed across regions, especially with respect to those AW practices carried out by farmers, while trust lies behind concerns. Three segments based on individual consumer attitudes are defined by opposing those consumers who are more concerned and who trust more on the compliance with AW standards (n=264, 22%) to those less concerned and who are more uncertain about stakeholders´ compliance with AW rules (n=356, 29%). Consumer location, gender, age and education significantly differed across attitudinal clusters. Results from a contingent valuation survey show that WTP for certified animal friendly beef ranged between 20.6% and 22.6% over the average market price of standard beef, in Spain and France, respectively. Both, consumers’ socio-demographic characteristics and habits regarding beef meat purchasing and attitudes towards farmers influenced this WTP (the more consumers trust in farmers’ involvement in animal welfare, the highest is their WTP), while a negative overall attitude significantly reduced WTP. © 2015 INIA.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the governance implications of non-genetically modified (GM) voluntary private standards on the private label poultry meat value chain of the leading Italian retailer. Considered aspects are: first, the organizational practices adopted along the chain to assure effective segregation; second, the changes in the characteristics and governance of the key transaction (meat processor-retailer); finally, what makes the chain economically sustainable. Design/methodology/approach – A picture of the chain is obtained collecting information from the businesses involved; the snowball selection criterion is used in identifying people to interview. Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) is used to conceptualize the organizational changes in the meat processor-retailer transaction; the coherence of expected-actual variations in asset specificity, uncertainty and frequency, as well as of the observed governance with TCE predictions is assessed. Findings – The creation of the non-GM chain required investments by both the key actors involved and the establishment of a partnership based on trust and mutual dependence. The increase in uncertainty coupled with the rise in asset specificity led to higher transaction costs, requiring a shift of the governance structure toward the right side of the market-hierarchy continuum to economize on costs and improve supply chain performance. TCE well explains the changes occurred. The retailer values the return on image as a strategic asset and bears the non-GM extra costs making the chain economically sustainable. Research limitations/implications – The implications of the findings are twofold. First, they help to identify the critical factors for an effective and economically sustainable segregation of non-GM products/raw materials along agro-food value chains. Second, they show how chain actors could adopt tighter governance structures in order to comply with binding technical and quality specifications, economize on transaction costs and improve supply chain performance. Originality/value – Retailer-led private standards used as regulation and enforcement mechanisms in vertical relations, as well as their organizational implications in the governance of transactions between actors in agro-food value chains have received insufficient attention. This research contributes to fill out this gap. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose of review: Many successful experiences of commercialisation of irradiated foods call for a revision of the predominant negative views on their acceptance by consumers and an adaptation of strategies to encourage further commercialisation. Findings: A significant number of consumers around the world have now purchased and re-purchased irradiated fresh produce, meat products and a few other products. The evidence is thus substantial that while a fraction of the public will not buy irradiated food, a much larger fraction will. Retailers have the key role since they decide whether or not they will offer irradiated food on their shelves. However, retailers generally still believe consumers will not purchase irradiated food. Communication on the products and on the benefits to consumers is more effective than providing technical details of the technology. Directions for future research: Proponents of food irradiation should channel their efforts and resources towards convincing retailers that they can engage in food irradiation without the risk of disrepute. Building trust in the systems that will deliver and regulate food irradiation is essential. Governments must take a science-based stand and create the conditions whereby consumers can exercise their free choice of buying or not buying irradiated food. More effort should be put into addressing issues such as lack of irradiation capacity, optimising supply chain reliability, developing facilities to treat food where food is finally packaged and encouraging the use of nonradioactive, accelerator-based sources. © 2015 SPS (UK) Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose of review: The pre-export application of agreed phytosanitary measures for economically important species of fruit flies (eg, Bactrocera tryoni - Queensland fruit fly) and other high risk pests are a critical aspect of New Zealand's biosecurity requirements. There are a number of successfully implemented treatments allowing for the commercial trade of fresh produce from Australia to New Zealand. The "tool box" of agreed measures include the application of post-harvest treatments such as heat treatments, cold disinfestation, chemical dips/sprays and methyl bromide fumigation. Other non-treatment options include sourcing products from recognised pest free areas (PFAs), the use of systems approaches and recognised non-host status. Over recent years, there has been a need to revise the commercial application for several of the historically recognised treatment options. In particular, the effective banning of dimethoate as an accepted post-harvest treatment option for several products required the development and implementation of new alternatives to facilitate the long-standing market access for important commodities such as mangoes, tomatoes and capsicums. The application of irradiation technology in this instance has successfully fulfilled an important technological and trade need. Furthermore, irradiation has also facilitated the market access for new commodities, such as lychees, and paved the way for the implementation of long-term and sustainable export-import programmes. Findings: A significant volume of irradiated mangoes, lychees, tomatoes and capsicums are now purchased by consumers in New Zealand. It is very clear that not only does irradiation fulfil a technological need but it also fulfils a consumer need by making quality produce available at competitive prices. Consequently, a significant proportion of the New Zealand public will consistently buy irradiated fresh produce when it is available to them. Directions for future research: The recent approval by FSANZ for the irradiation of a range of new commodities will open up further opportunities for both new market access (eg, for cherries and other stone fruit) and also provide a commercially viable treatment alternative for products with existing market access to New Zealand (eg, grapes). Since the commercial application of irradiation treatments has now been in place for more than a decade, trust and confidence in the technical effectiveness of the treatment has improved as well as consumer acceptance. Significant investments in associated infra-structure requirements directly relevant to the fresh produce supplychain (eg, maintaining the cold-chain before, during and after treatment) has also sent positive signals that irradiation is a sustainable and long-term option amongst the current toolbox of treatment options. Governments and regulators must now build on the existing science-based approvals and take a more pragmatic stand to ensure that the regulatory frameworks and approval processes are less obstructive and time consuming so that consumers can exercise their free choice of buying or not buying a wider range of irradiated produce. © 2015 SPS (UK) Ltd.},

abstract={Transparency in meat supply chains is necessary to guarantee the safety, quality and trust of consumers in meat products. However, transparency systems currently in place are often not adequate for sharing transparency data among food operators, providing consumers accurate transparency information, or enabling authorities to respond quickly and effectively in cases of food safety emergencies. Due to major meat crises and scandals the meat sector has in this respect attracted substantial attention. In this paper we identify regulatory, business, consumer and technological requirements for meat supply chain transparency systems and present a reference software architecture that will guide the realisation of these systems. The reference architecture is characterized by three main elements: the EPCIS standard for tracking and tracing, cloud-based realisation of transparency systems, and the provision of transparency systems as services by third-party transparency service providers (3pTSPs). Usage scenarios are presented to explain how the different types of meat supply chain actors can use transparency systems that are based on the architecture. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This case uses an example of a progressive women farmer entrepreneur (Hiruth) operating a dairy business in Ethiopia and offer valuable lessons for businesses operating in Africa and elsewhere in the world. While on the market side, the demand for milk based products is on the rise in Ethiopia, the supply side poses several known challenges. Due to supply shortage of the right quality milk, most processing facilities operate at 50% to 60% of their capacity. In such an operating environment, Hiruth has managed to create and grow her business at a rapid pace. This case demonstrates how Hiruth managed to build her supply base loyalty by assuring purchase and quality based price premium and managed to build a fool-proof supply chain. By positioning herself as an orchestrator of the chain rather than just as a buyer has enabled her to build a robust chain and a growing business. © 2014 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).},

abstract={In the last decade, the durum wheat-pasta production chain was been, with the other food chains, vulnerable to prices volatility, that became stronger in the last five years due to the unfavourable economic condition. The supply chains internal competition and the unwillingness to cooperation, directly linked to lack of trust between actors on different levels, represent barriers for the efficiency this economic structure (the chain), that have to deal with the actual economic condition and the global market competition. The Italian durum wheat-pasta production chain is characterized by a high level of vertical integration for the downstream stages (mills and pasta industries) and by a farms-pasta industries contracts increase; whereas very high is the upstream stage firms' fragmentation. The study aims to examine the Apulian durum wheat-pasta production chain, by means of the netchain analysis methodology, to point out its organisational set-up and its degree of integration and evaluate the horizontal and vertical existent relationships. The geographical location of the study is due to the importance that durum wheat has for the Region; that is in the first place of the national production ranking (almost the 20, 65% in 2011), and have a great territory specialisation (almost the 87, 68% of cereals regional uaa). The study started from the analysis of a quality product chain that can be considered as a best practice into the area because both the final product (dry pasta) is made from local durum wheat flour only, and the whole chain are certified ("Prodotti di qualità di Puglia" and dnv Business Assurance). The results obtained, show an high horizontal integration for farms. However, they are able to create ties only with selling cooperatives. The latter on the other hand, show the capability to promote cohesion between farms and mills for the supply of high quality raw materials. This chain, observed for its peculiarity of being a best practice, show the relevance of pasta industries in promoting strong horizontal and vertical relationships, and theirs importance in improving chain market competitiveness. Further studies are still necessary, since a more comprehensive analysis of the entire Apulian chain, considering also those one located into areas with an higher number of pasta industries (eg. Emilia-Romagna), can provide essential information that can be used to drive innovation in chain governance at the regional or national level. © FrancoAngeli.},

abstract={Although Bangladesh's livestock population provides a significant resource of raw material for value addition, the export performance of the leather processing sector is poor. Internally sourced raw hides and skins (RHS) dominate the procurement structure, but are subject to cultural-religious traditions. This study seeks to investigate the extent that the three-day Festival of Sacrifice (Eid-ul-Azha), on which every year Muslims sacrifice millions of animals to Allah and which accounts for more than 40% of the annual RHS production constrains the industry's competitiveness.Based on the global value chain approach, our findings are drawn from qualitative data. We show that Eid-ul-Azha leads to a temporary oversupply of RHS, which results in serious challenges in the organization of the value chain. Our results point to the special role of systemic trust ensured by religious requirements for sacrificial animals and thus RHS, which enables middlemen to enter the supply chain temporarily. Despite their flexible and voluminous small-scale collection, temporary middlemen lack experience and competences to adequately assess quality and price, thus affecting the competitiveness of downstream actors, in particular the tanneries.Our findings complement the concept of global value chains by stressing the impact of culture-specific constraints, temporarily available resources and trust in relations to middlemen on the competitiveness of the export-oriented leather industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Foodbanks Australia is the largest group of organisations providing food banks operations in Australia. In 2010/2011 they distributed about 21 million kilograms of food at little or no cost to approximately 2,500 welfare agencies in the emergency relief sector across Australia. The food comes from organisations throughout the food supply chain from farmers to supermarkets. Recent innovations in this supply include sourcing food from urban agriculture and organising Collaborative Supply Programs with manufacturers. Foodbanks supply much of the food that emergency relief agencies give to people in need as meals or as take home supplies. Providing food helps Emergency Relief organisations meet their clients' immediate physical needs and develops trust enabling other services, such as counselling to address the underlying causes, to be offered and accepted by clients. Emergency Relief organisations and Foodbanks have a distinct role to play in emergencies but should not be seen as part of a solution for social inequity. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

abstract={Agricultural supply chains in East Kalimantan are characterized by shortterm relationships, yet some chains have managed to develop longer term and closer relationships based on trust and commitment. This study aims to examine the main factors that have initiated trust. Thirty one key informants in the chains were interviewed to explore their perspective on trust, commitment and how their business relationships evolved. The study shows that credit payments, where a supplier allows the customer to complete the payment in stages, or after the customer has sold the products, without incurring any interest, was a key factor in initiating trust in new business relationships. The main reason for these types of payments is the large number of small scale businesses which require chain members to be more tolerant of their exchange partners. Although tolerating debtors may seem like a loss, it is the starting point for trust to grow. This paper will discuss the forms of trust and commitment arising from these relationships, the development of trust, commitment and the benefits to members of the chains.},

abstract={An effective and efficient supply chain requires farmers, traders, wholesalers and retailers to develop and maintain close relationships with their trading partners. The relationship constructs: satisfaction, trust, commitment, communication, coordination and power were utilised in an examination of the exchange relationships between cut flower growers and their downstream trading partners in the cut flower industry in Da Lat, Viet Nam. In the absence of any significant relationship specific investments, farmers were free to choose their preferred trading partner. Contrary to much of the literature, coercive market power was seldom exercised. Enduring longterm relationships were primarily built upon trust through established and satisfying personal relationships.},

abstract={Today's horticultural supply chains are faced with intense pressure regarding food safety, food integrity, supply risk, quality and trust. Competitive pressures increase with increasing consumer demand as well as increased competition. As part of sustaining the supply chain from its source, a conceptual framework of procurement flexibility is suggested. As procurement occurs at every entity along a supply chain, this framework can be used for streamlining and optimisation. Strategic procurement flexibility becomes critical when the internal and external business environments change rapidly. This concept of strategic procurement flexibility enables the rapid modification of sourcing and transport operations, which are critical for perishable products. This concept is reviewed through the literature and matched with current issues of food safety, integrity, supply risk, quality and trust to develop a sustainable and flexible horticultural procurement model. This model is expected to provide competitive advantage in operational flexibility for perishable horticultural products.},

abstract={Pyrethrum is one of Tanzania's traditional export crops earning the country significant revenue through the sale of crude extract. Although the world market for pyrethrum plummeted between 2000/2001 and 2003/2004, it is still a potentially valuable crop for improving smallholder farmer livelihoods. Over the last five years, the Pyrethrum Company of Tanzania has been providing a range of incentives and support to pyrethrum growers including prompt payment for produce delivered by farmers, the provision of extension support services, transport for produce to the processing plant in Mafinga, and the provision of planting materials to smallholder farmers at no cost. Even so, smallholder growers continue to face multiple challenges that limit their effective participation in the pyrethrum supply chain. Providing a consistent, high volume supply of homogeneous raw material, the delivery of which is synchronized with distribution and processing operations is a major challenge. This emphasises the need for collective action and cooperation to aggregate produce on a scale required by the market when the processor wants it. We conclude that unless group bulking arrangements are enhanced to meet market requirements, while also rewarding individual farmers' efforts to achieve the required product quality, smallholder farmers will have little incentive to comply with best practice standards. By facilitating group supply strategies and by having transparent pricing structures, there will be greater trust and commitment by smallholder growers participating in the pyrethrum supply chain.},

abstract={The growing distrust of consumers in the safety of food is widely documented in both developed and transitional economies. This is related to the growing intensification and industrialisation of food production and processing, as well as the growing distance between food production and food consumption sites. Farmers commonly complain about the increasing marketing power of modern distribution, which often imposes unfavourable terms of exchange and discourages efforts to implement quality assurance systems. In the literature, proximity between producers and consumers - be it geographical or relational - is said to be advantageous in many respects. Geographical proximity is economically more efficient in perishable commodity supply chains compared to more distant supply areas. Regular interaction between producers and consumers and between buyers and sellers promotes trust, the sharing of information, joint investment and risk-taking, with a sense of responsibility on both sides. An alternative to proximity is standardisation and certification, but these processes generate costs that are difficult for smallholder farmers to bear. On the other hand, the literature is increasingly challenging the so-called superiority of proximity over distance as regards food chain sustainability. When distant supply areas are characterised by specialisation and large-scale production, this may result in economies of scale and lower costs in terms of production and transport. Trust cannot circumvent all risks of moral hazard. Regular interaction combined with some form of control and certification is desirable, even if based only on some minimal process of documentation. It is better to promote complementarities between personal trust and standards, and between short and long chains, rather than to consider them as opposites.},

abstract={With 77% of the population living in rural areas, the development of agriculture is critical in reducing poverty in Cambodia. The growing demand for better quality vegetables offers farming families good opportunities to increase incomes and reduce their dependency on rice. Despite considerable progress in recent years, business opportunities are being lost as a result of a predominantly supply-driven approach and the slow rate of technology adoption within the sector. To strengthen the competitiveness of the Cambodian vegetable industry and to deliver elements of economic and environmental sustainability, there is an urgent need for the sector to embrace a market-driven approach. Strengthening trust and the dialogue between supply chain actors facilitates the coordination needed to act upon market signals. Using examples from a cooperation project between GIZ and East West Seed, this paper discusses the need for improved access to information and appropriate technology, and the significance this has in reducing risk and improving the incomes of smallholder farmers. The provision of embedded services and the pull of market forces are recommended as practical alternatives to the subsidies and market interference which presently plagues the sector. Fostering private sector initiatives which drive productivity, improve quality and increase the incomes of rural communities are presented as a viable and sustainable way for government and development agencies to complement traditional approaches to extension.},

abstract={Ethical aspects of consumption of fast moving consumer goods, have received increased attention during the last decade. In part, this can be explained by an increasing awareness among consumers at large of environmental and social issues that are embedded in the production of fast moving consumer goods, such as food products. Standards and eco-labels serve as a guiding support for consumer choices, but the role of the food retailer, above and beyond providing services and information for the consumers, is a matter of making corporate decisions in line with responsible corporate governance. This paper aims to explore corporate responsibility, CR, in terms of ethical sourcing in category management, which selection reflects the overall corporate value grounds and create basis for differentiation. Categories are seen as single business units, where considering ethical aspects in business decisions might be conflicting with strategic goals such as profit maximization on a corporate level. Therefore, in a practical setting, category management concerns making choices regarding in which way and what products should be offered in the food retail stores. Key research questions target the conditions for making strategic choices; who are the stakeholders? And what values are given priority? The paper is based on a qualitative research design where two food retail case studies are presented as illustrations of conditions and challenges in addressing complex corporate responsibility issues. These case studies adopt a corporate perspective of key food retailers in Sweden and their approach to managing social and environmental issues in supply chains. Research findings illustrate the central position for food retailers in the supply chain. Yet, it is unlikely that solutions to complex problems, such as those embedded in supply chains, can be achieved by a single actor since businesses that respond individually to complex challenges often find the competitive environment restricting their activities. An extended stakeholder dialogue, in terms of industrial networks and multi-stakeholder dialogue, offers valuable exchange of knowledge and an opportunity to balance a wide set of values and interests. Corporate challenges of creating legitimacy are associated with the selection of dialogue partners, perceptions of created shared values, communicational efforts made to establish trust, and, the underlying query of corporate raison d'être. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the preferred minimum level of segregation for halal meat in supermarket, transport, storage and terminals; the responsibility of halal logistics; and the willingness to pay for halal logistics in a Muslim and non-Muslim country. Design/methodology/approach: This is a comparative study involving Muslim consumers in Malaysia and The Netherlands. Cross-sectional data were collected through a survey with 251 Muslims in Malaysia and 250 Muslims in The Netherlands. Data were analysed by means of nonparametric tests. Findings: There is a preferred higher level of segregation in a Muslim country than a non-Muslim country. A Muslim country has a higher willingness to pay for a halal logistics system as compared to a non-Muslim country. Furthermore, there lies a heavy responsibility with the manufacturer to extend halal assurance towards supply chain management. Research limitations/implications: The study confirms there is a need for a different level of segregation and therefore different halal logistics standard in a Muslim country and a non-Muslim country. However, during the survey in The Netherlands significant rejections were received from especially first generation Muslims due to the lack of understanding of the Dutch language. Similar surveys need to be conducted in other countries in order to be able to generalise over the various Islamic schools of thought, local fatwas and local customs. Practical implications: Halal logistics is important to the Muslim consumer and critical for the trust in a halal certified brand, which requires extending halal integrity from point of production to the point of consumer purchase. Originality/value: This study is a preliminary one investigating the consumer perception on halal logistics. The study indicates the level of segregation required for a halal meat supply chain in a Muslim and non-Muslim country. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper examines the role played by different units in the supply chain that ensure consumer confidence in the process of production. Analysis of interviews with the managers of various units in the chain of custody showed that, as we move from the buyer to the production units, the building-up of trust by managers is becoming increasingly technical. Thus, end consumers include the intangible value of the product in their understanding of trust regarding Russian wood. The lower the unit is in the chain of custody and the closer it is situated to the logging sites, the more restricted is the construction of trust by managers, undergoing minimization and, ultimately, reduction in the bid to ensure a "normal" business or purely technical approach. The differences observed in the constructions of trust in various units of the chain can be explained in light of two factors: firstly, the challenges faced by each individual unit, and secondly, the value system of the managers at every level. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present an integrated modelling framework that links management action to supply chain processes and then to competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: Using survey responses about supply chain management in the Australian beef processing industry, regression analysis was used to develop a model simultaneously explaining the links from management action to supply chain processes and on to competitive advantage. Findings: A relatively simple regression model was established that should be widely applicable in agri-food processing industries. In the context of our example industry, the results suggest that there is a strong link from some supply chain practices to competitive advantage, with trust and information quality being important drivers of the process. Research limitations/implications: Being based on a survey approach, a limitation is that that the results show managers' perceived influences on supply chain performance, not the influences observed by the researchers. Practical implications: The regression method provides an easy way of summarising the links between supply chain practices and competitive advantage. This method may be generally applicable across agri-food industries, particularly those with many small and medium-size food enterprises. Originality/value: This research provides a new method of integrating various aspects of supply chain management and competitive advantage. The method has the great advantage of parsimony. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how food manufacturers in Sweden define and view innovations, how they view their role and those of other actors and the interaction/collaboration regarding innovations in the food supply/value chain. Design/methodology/approach: After an exploratory pre-study with 12 participants, a full study of Swedish manufacturers comprised of representatives from 12 food companies was initiated. In total, 21 interviews were carried out. The majority of the respondents had food industry experience. They initially answered structured questions and thereafter open-ended ones. Findings: Few, if any, innovations in the Swedish food sector are considered radical. Many are "invisible" to meet demands for lower cost, shorter orders and sustainability. The food manufacturers seem to develop products in house for consumers and not by working with them or others inside or outside the supply chain; they do not adopt an "open" innovation mindset. There is lack of trust in the chain and limited exchange of information. Some manufacturers pursue horizontal collaboration with other manufacturers abroad. Research limitations/implications: Innovations and strategies are a competitive edge for a company, so the respondents may not have been completely open. Practical implications: Manufacturers and the whole supply chain would benefit from an "open innovation" mindset to organise and work differently and build trust. Originality/value: There is no other published study on innovations and food manufacturers in Sweden. The food sector should embark on collaboration and coopetion and initiate discussions on what can be done to become more innovative. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The company has announced to end all natural forest clearing in its supply chains in Indonesia starting from February 2013. TFT is working on the ground with the company to implement and monitor the work. TFT understands that there is huge interest in APP's progress implementing its new Forest Conservation Policy (FCP) and has decided to report more regularly on the work being done in the field. The company and TFT have developed a series of protocols to guide implementation before announcing the implementation of the new FCP on February 5, 2013. Early engagement with local civil society in Indonesia has been critical to developing a strong multi-stakeholder implementation approach.},

abstract={Research results show that people do not act according to the assumptions of homo oeconomicus and that there is injustice aversion. Apart from price, other factors influence the fairness perception. This study analyses, how fair consumers feel treated by agriculture, food industry and food retailing and which factors are relevant for the perception of fairness. Therefore, a consumer survey was conducted. Food industry and retail are perceived as unfair while agriculture is evaluated better. Most important factor influencing the perception is trust in quality and product declaration for all steps of the supply chain. © 2013, OGA-Osterreichische Gesellschaft fur Agrarokonomie.

abstract={This paper is a literature review that focuses on the development of Alternative Agri-Food Networks (aafns) and, in particular, on the development of Short Food Supply Chains (sfscs). In the first part of the article we give a description of the social-cultural and environmental aspects which define aafns. aafns are generally thought of as a "turn" from industrialized and standardized systems to the "domestic" world, where quality is interpreted in terms of food localization, proximity relations, trust, tradition and place, and as a new form of rural development and an instrument to revitalize rural areas. We verified that mainly two factors mostly influence the characterization of the alternative food streams: embeddedness and food localization. The concept of embeddedness integrates social, environmental and health issues, while re-localization defines the tendency to build networks based on production and consumption of local food and the development of a "local culture", based on the valuation of food origin, community traditions and food habits. The second part of the paper is focused on the description of sfscs, as Farmers' Markets or Community Supported Agriculture, which aim at reducing the number of transactions along the food supply chain and the distance between the production and consumption of food products. The development of sfscs may help to provide various benefits support of the local economy, the strengthening of relations between consumers and their food traditions, the supply of fresher food products in comparison to conventional food networks, the re-valuation of the small-scale farmer's role in the food systems, the use of sustainable production methods and the reduction of co2 emissions. This supposition has been contradicted by several recent pieces of research, and we have pointed out further criticisms of sfscs, such as the costs farmers have to bear when selling directly to the public. The article ends by setting out our considerations regarding the development of aafns and sfscs and offers some suggestions, for starting points for future research. Copyright © FrancoAngeli.},

abstract={Globally, fish and fish products are a major food commodity, and the fish processing industry is an economically important sector. Persistent overexploitation of fish stocks, and illegal fishing, threaten to a great extent the future sufficient availability of the important natural resource fish. Additionally fraud along the supply chain, false labelling of fish and fish products, mislead the consumer and has a negative impact on consumer trust and the industry. Also, in many areas of the world, aquaculture production is on a steep rise which might lead to environmental challenges, for example, when fish escape from farms and breed with their wild counterparts which is why it is important to be able to distinguish between wild and farmed fish of the same species. These examples show that the fisheries and aquaculture sector relies on efficient traceability schemes allowing to determine the origin of fish and fish products. This chapter discusses measures taken to ensure fish and fish product traceability and presents modern analytical technologies and applications, which can considerably strengthen traceability 'Ocean to Fork'. These analytical technologies have to answer three key questions, ideally also on processed products: 'What species is it?'; 'Where does it come from?' and 'Is it of farmed or wild origin?'. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={If carbon (C) sinks withdraw carbohydrates as they are transported along tree stems, carbohydrate availability may depend on local sink strength and distance from sources. Defenses, including monoterpenes - a major component of resin - limit the invasibility of pines. Since carbohydrate reserves fund monoterpene synthesis, we hypothesized that monoterpene concentrations in pine stems would decrease from the crown to the lower stem, and susceptibility to fungal infection would increase. Here, we measured carbohydrate and monoterpene concentrations along the stems of lodgepole pine trees (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) before inoculating with a blue-stain fungus at different heights. After 6 wk, we assessed tree responses to fungal infection based on lesion length and carbohydrate mobilization. Concentrations of carbohydrates and monoterpenes in the phloem before inoculation decreased with distance from the crown, whereas lesion lengths after inoculation increased. However, trees mobilized sugars in response to fungal infection such that carbohydrate reserves near lesions were similar at all heights. Despite C mobilization, the lower stem was more vulnerable than the upper stem. Consistent with predictions based on sink-source relationships, vulnerability occurred where carbohydrates were less available, and likely resulted from C withdrawal by sinks higher in the supply chain. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the United States will initiate a federal emergency response effort that will consist of disease control and eradication efforts, including quarantine and movement control measures. These movement control measures will not only apply to live animals but also to animal products. However, with current egg industry "just-in-time" production practices, limited storage is available to hold eggs. As a result, stop movement orders can have significant unintended negative consequences, including severe disruptions to the food supply chain. Because stakeholders' perceptions of risk vary, waiting to initiate communication efforts until an HPAI event occurs can hinder disease control efforts, including the willingness of producers to comply with the response, and also can affect consumers' demand for the product. A public-private-academic partnership was formed to assess actual risks involved in the movement of egg industry products during an HPAI event through product specific, proactive risk assessments. The risk analysis process engaged a broad representation of stakeholders and promoted effective risk management and communication strategies before an HPAI outbreak event. This multidisciplinary team used the risk assessments in the development of the United States Department of Agriculture, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Secure Egg Supply Plan, a comprehensive response plan that strives to maintain continuity of business. The collaborative approach that was used demonstrates how a proactive risk communication strategy that involves many different stakeholders can be valuable in the development of a foreign animal disease response plan and build working relationships, trust, and understanding.},

abstract={Triffid is the name given to a genetically modified (GM) variety of flaxseed that was developed in the late 1980s at the University of Saskatchewan's Crop Development Centre. The variety was designed to thrive in soil containing residues from sulfonylureatype herbicides and offered greater weed control options to flax growers. In 1998, Triffid received Canadian and American feed and food regulatory approvals and entered a seed multiplication program. The following year, Europe threatened to stop importing Canadian flax should GM flax enter into commercial production. By April 2001, Triffid was deregistered and all remaining seed was supposedly destroyed. However, in late 2009, Triffid flax was unexpectedly detected in EU food products and in subsequent flax imports into Europe from Canada. In response to this, the EU immediately halted Canadian flax imports. This article documents Canadian costs of the Triffid flax issue as an example of low level presence (LLP) of an unapproved transformation event in a zero-tolerance European market. It explores/evaluates the impacts (economic and social costs) on the Canadian industry-including the development of a stewardship program and testing protocols, the engagement and relationship strategies utilized in negotiations with the EU to resolve market access, and the overall industry response to the issue (from producers to exporters). The article presents survey responses from more than 270 Western Canadian flax farmers. This survey data provides new insights as to how farmers manage LLP on-farm. The production attributes that are examined range from field agronomics to ability to export. Specifically, it examines how farmers have dealt with flax, in terms of production and sale, since the Fall of 2009. Detailed analysis is provided for the following supply chain components: on-farm testing, carryover costs, and opportunity costs. Finally, the article provides some insights as to who farmers trust in terms of communicating information to them on how to best manage this situation. ©2012 AgBioForum.},

abstract={Purpose: Research on buyer-seller relationships in the agricultural sector receives little attention. A growing body of evidence suggests that strengthening buyer-seller relationships fosters more efficient supply chains. Much of the long-term relationship literature tends to treat suppliers as a homogeneous group when identifying motivations, strategies and incentives to enhance the quality of buyer-seller relationships. This article aims to explore the role of long-term relationships between buyers and sellers in Malaysia's dairy industry, taking into consideration the heterogeneous nature of producers. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines variation in relationship quality (trust, satisfaction, and commitment), loyalty and price satisfaction dimensions, using data from a survey of 133 dairy producers. Findings: Cluster analysis suggests two well-defined groups differing in terms of demographic characteristics and relationship perceptions about their buyers. Practical implications: The study results highlight ways milk buyers can develop and promote more appropriate and efficient marketing strategies with milk producers. Originality/value: This study provides evidence of producer relationship segmentation in an agricultural industry of an emerging economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Sugar from cane remains an important economic contributor in many countries. A lack of collaboration has been identified as a key problem in many of these regions. To date, few sugar researchers have exploited the valuable supply chain collaboration knowledge available in the literature, such as the Supply Chain Collaboration Index (SCCI). This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from three sugarcane milling areas. The SCCI was contextualised from a psychological perspective and used in the quantitative data analyses. A special objective was to raise a number of pertinent questions, which would fast track stakeholders to a new level of collaboration. Findings: Many relationships in the supply chain remain relatively positive. The main attributes of concern are stability, reliability, trust, personal relationships and communication. A lack of these attributes causes fragmentation, opportunism and a desire to over-control. Mutuality and communication are key leverages in the system. Research limitations/implications: There is a need to understand how collaboration could be enhanced when stakeholders hold different balances of power. This study is still limited to sugarcane milling in South Africa. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates a partially quantitative research methodology to understand collaboration in a food supply chain. The authors also propose a tool to help industry stakeholders to resolve current problems. Originality/value: The psychological profiling of SCCI attributes and subsequent correspondence analyses is original. A framework of collaboration questions combined with Kepner-Tregoe Problem Analyses is unique. These tools are generic to any agricultural supply chain. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Objective: Safety and quality associated with the production, marketing and consumption of food, together with overall levels of trust in the food supply chain, are increasing in importance in our society. The aim of this study was to identify the demographic differences in a range of safety and quality variables in regard to levels of consumer trust in the food supply chain. Design: An Australia-wide population telephone survey on a random sample of the Australian population aged 18+ years of age was undertaken. Univariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken on each of the eight safety and quality variables and one composite variable. Setting: Australia. Subjects: In total, 1108 interviews with 49.3% of the sample males and with a mean age of 45.12 years (SD 17.63). Results: Multivariate analysis indicated that gender (females), age (older persons) and annual household income (lower income) were the demographic groups more likely to be included in the final models that considered various quality and safety issues to be important. Higher education was related to more importance being placed on the variable assessing the importance of the producer maintain control of hygiene but lower education level was related to the variable assessing the importance of the premises being tested regularly by inspectors. Conclusion: The perceptions that adults place upon the safety and quality of food are important in ultimately defining, amongst other things, their food buying choices. As such, this research has highlighted demographic characteristics associated with the importance placed on a wide range of safety and quality issues so as to assist in providing evidence for targeting of appropriate campaigns to increase consumer confidence. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Taking into consideration the management of information into the "small pelagic fish chain", the analysis started from the hypothesis that in a dynamic and complex competitive scenario, the ability to manage the information flow allows the creation of value and competitive advantages for the companies and the whole system itself. The study focused on the results of the analysis of data collected during 8 in-depth interviews with operators of the fishery sector. Interviewees were asked to express an evaluation of their availability to get/provide specific information from/to their own clients and to give their opinion about problems connected with the different types of information taken into account. The study returned the picture of a system that needs to mature, overcoming both the strong orientation towards individualism and the lack of trust in the other actors towards respecting common decisions. The adoption of common choices could help overtake the fear of harnessing the business, and transform the high potential of the system into visible results.},

abstract={Drawing on survey data, this article identifies the determinants of variations in farm gate milk prices for three CIS countries (Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine). We apply a multi-level modeling approach, specifically a bootstrapped mixed-effects linear regression model. The analysis suggests three main strategies to improve the price received by farmers for their output: consolidation, competition for output, and stable supply chain relationships. In Armenia and Ukraine selling through a marketing cooperative has a significant, positive, albeit modest, effect on farm gate milk prices. In all three countries studied, the size of dairy operations, trust, and contracting also affect positively the prices received by farmers. © 2011 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

This study seeks to answer what exactly determines firms' investments in traceability systems by developing and testing a theoretical framework using partial least squares methodology and empirical data from 234 companies of the German food industry.The results reveal that high external pressure to implement improves the image of tracking and tracing systems in the sense that their use enhances a firm's status, increases the intention to use those systems and fosters their perceived usefulness in the eyes of agribusiness executives. The hypothesized negative effect of costs on perceived usefulness and the intention to invest could not be verified. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to segment Taiwanese consumers based on their trust in the food supply system and to demographically characterize each segment so as to aid the actors and institutions involved in the food supply system in formulating more effective communication strategies for different segments and to assist the consumers in increasing their trust in food safety. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 592 useful responses were elicited as the data input for cluster analysis, repeated measures ANOVA tests, and chi-square tests. Findings: Cluster analysis reveals that the 592 respondents in Taiwan can be segmented into three clusters: consumers who are pessimistic, neutral, or optimistic about food safety. Moreover, the repeated measures ANOVA tests for each segment disclose that among the food supply system the foods imported from abroad are perceived by the three clusters to be the least, while the government responsible for food safety inspection and checking the most, trustworthy. The chi-square test results reveal that the pessimistic consumers seem to be composed of a higher percentage of respondents whose level of education and amount of monthly income are below average. Practical implications: For food safety a government agency, TFDA, has been set up to be in charge of the task of monitoring conscientiously all of the players in the food supply chain, including the importation system. Originality/value: This is the first study to segment Taiwanese consumers based on their trust in the food supply system. Based on the findings, suggestions are provided to benefit the actors and institutions involved in the food supply system in Taiwan. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Plant diseases can impact on crop yields and disrupt food supply chains. It is surprising, therefore, that a detailed analysis of key actor responses to disease risk has not been undertaken. This paper examines grower and agronomist perceptions, and their relationships, in the management of plant disease in two UK arable sectors: wheat and potatoes. Applying social science concepts of risk, trust and agricultural knowledges, interviews were conducted with 30 growers and 10 agronomists in Lincolnshire (Eastern England) and Herefordshire (West Midlands). A majority of growers had a broad fungicide spray programme for their crops, rather than a formal plan, and this was guided by their previous experiences and advice from agronomists. For agronomists, flexible spray programmes were also seen as essential, based on knowledge of the local area, disease pressure and prevailing weather patterns. Neither growers nor agronomists rely solely on scientific knowledge (risk as analysis) in their decision-making and intuitive responses (risk as feeling) also play an important role in plant disease management. The influence of agronomists varies from almost complete grower dependence to occasional use and verification. However, the knowledge exchange encounters between growers and agronomists are increasingly interactive and reflect personality and the accumulation of trust between them rather than factors such as farm size, farm type, area and the age of the farmer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, we have witnessed three parallel and intertwined trends: First, food retail and processing firms have embraced private standards, usually with some form of third party certification employed to verify adherence to those standards. Second, firms have increasingly aligned themselves with, as opposed to fighting off, environmental, fair trade, and other NGOs. Third, firms have embraced supply chain management as a strategy for increasing profits and market share. Together, these trends are part and parcel of the neoliberal blurring of the older liberal distinction between state and civil society. In this paper I ask what the implications of these changes are from the vantage point of the three major approaches to ethics: consequentialism, virtue theory, and rights theory. What are the consequences of these changes for food safety, for suppliers, for consumers? What virtues (e. g., trust, fairness) are these changes likely to embrace and what vices may accompany them? Whose rights will be furthered or curtailed by these changes? © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={While the area of food chain coordination has received considerable attention in the academic and managerial literature during the past years, there are many unanswered questions regarding the dynamics of managing international food supply chains, especially in horticulture. In order to achieve growth and to create value from an international food supply chain, it needs to be managed as an interconnected system which is held together by a number of complex relationships. Active food chain coordination aims to effectively manage such systems. One of the current discussions in the literature is who assumes the coordination function in these chains and with which capabilities and resources. The effectiveness of chain coordination is believed to be a function of the coordinators' innate or acquired ability, their management style, tangible resources, and the efforts they make to effectively utilize resources. Effective coordination builds trust, motivation and contributes to improved supply chain performance and competitiveness. This paper presents a two-stage conceptual supply chain coordination/performance model and posits hypotheses that will be tested in future empirical research.},

abstract={Studies have shown that consumer goodwill is often renewable at little cost. Firms are more interested in direct marketing when it allows them to capitalize on consumer goodwill. Other studies have shown that firms which practice corporate social responsibility have a marketing edge. Another body of research emphasizes the importance of product quality in earning consumer loyalty and goodwill. The difficulty for consumers wishing to buy organic products is the veracity of the firms' organic claims. There are multiple channels for marketing organic products in Taiwan, including specialty shops, supermarkets and chain stores. Lee Zen is a successful supply chain growing exponentially in Taiwan. It currently has 160 ha of land, 433 accredited farmers, three logistics centres and 76 stores selling fresh organic produce and processed food. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors contributing to the sustainability of the chain, including production, marketing and distribution. The results show that Lee Zen has been able to earn considerable consumer goodwill through its practice of corporate social responsibility. On the supply side, Lee Zen is trusted by contract farmers and consumers for their organic practices. The company's success can be attributed to the wheel of wellness theory, the principle of enlightened business, Senge's mental model, and the Confucian individual success model. This study indicates that the supply, marketing and distribution of organic products requires the trust of producers, retailers and consumers who all benefit from having a vision that is ethical and socially responsible.},

abstract={The paper examines relationships and linkages between the conventional supply chain actors (wholesalers and retailers) and local food producers based on a study conducted in Southeast Michigan. A case study approach was employed to examine chain actors' operations and to explore their roles, experiences and perceptions about local foods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the owners and managers of eleven retailers and six wholesalers. The study found differences in local food perceptions, buying experiences and perceived benefits and risks associated with local food sourcing activities. The study also identified some competition between local independent food retailers and alternative market outlets. The major implication of the findings is that producers need to provide additional market services and develop trust-based relationships with their buyers to create better market access for local foods. © 2011 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is first, to develop constructs to measure three important concepts in the supply chain literature: contracts, trust and market environment, in the Chinese context and to further investigate the relationships amongst these three concepts based on the formulated hypothesis. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology has strictly followed the recommended scale development procedures, which include specifying each constructs, item generation, data collection, reliability and validity test, and finally test hypothesis. The primary data were collected in October 2008 in Hubei Province, China. Both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis are applied to assess the reliability and validity of the three constructs. Findings - In total, 22 items were retained to measure six dimensions for the three core concepts: contract (marketing and production), trust (reliability and benevolence), and market environments (diversity and volatility). Second, the finding supported this argument that contracts and trust functions as complements. Furthermore, a positive relationship between environmental uncertainty and the use of contractual governance was found. Research limitations/implications - The measurement model for environmental volatility is less satisfied. More research should be carried out on the measurement of market environment in the future. Originality/value - This paper identifies and validates key constructs underlying supply chain management research: contract, trust and market environment, in a Chinese context. These measurable concepts could be applied in similar settings to further investigate small-scale farmer's position along the supply chain. Copyright © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

abstract={This study aims at contributing to a better understanding of the linkage between supply chain performance and possible performance improvement with respect to food quality and safety. Therefore, the article addresses the question whether the level of collaborative planning and close supply chain relationships could help improve the quality and safety of organic supply chains. The study was conducted as part of the multi-disciplinary EU-wide survey of organic supply chains, carried out in eight European countries. In this article we report the results of the study regarding the structures and performance of six different organic supply chains in these eight European countries for: milk (CH, UK), apples (DE, CH), pork (UK, NL), eggs (DE, UK), wheat (HU, IT, FR) and tomatoes (IT, NL). In-depth interviews with key-informants were carried out in 2006 to investigate the structures, performance, and relationships within the supply chains. Results show a low level of collaboration among various actors especially in cost and benefit sharing. Highly integrated supply chains show higher collaboration especially in the domain of Decision Synchronization. Trust and collaboration appear to be related with increased performance, whereas the higher the perceived risk for quality and safety, the higher the probability of supply chain collaboration. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={There is an emerging body of literature analyzing how smallholder farmers in developing countries can be linked to modern supply chains. However, most of the available studies concentrate on farm and farmer characteristics, failing to capture details of institutional arrangements between farmers and traders. Moreover, farmers' preferences have rarely been considered. Here, we address these gaps by analyzing different market channels for sweet pepper in Thailand. Using data from a survey and choice experiment with farmers, we find that there is a general preference for marketing options that do not involve a contract. Additional provision of inputs and credit can increase the attractiveness of contracts. Yet, the most important factor for farmers is to personally know the buyer they deal with, which may be related to issues of trust. Some policy implications are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The main objective of this article is to review the research by agricultural economists over the past decade on linking smallholder farmers to agri-food supply chains in Southern Africa, and to consider international and local urban trends in the development of such supply chains. The research reviewed covers the constraints placed by transaction costs on access by smallholder farmers to input and product markets; the potential role of contracting in linking smallholders to agribusiness firms; linking smallholders to supermarkets; equity-share schemes; the role of trust in a business relationship; promoting investment in smallholder agriculture by developing rental markets in communal areas; and the role of collective action (e.g., the formation of cooperatives, investor-owned firms or trusts) in promoting access to input and product markets. The development of alternative food networks in urban areas, which face a growing influx of poor people, could provide opportunities for smallholders, as individuals or groups, to supply the communities with the products and services they desire. © Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

abstract={Due to the number of food-related incidents and reported outbreaks worldwide, food quality and food safety have become a hot topic, also in everyday life. But risk perception research indicates that common people perceive risks differently from experts. Although outbreaks of food poisoning are usually well documented in the media, there is very little attention paid to the outbreaks which occur as consequence of improper food handling at home. Consumers in everyday life often do not respect basic principles of food safety and as such, at the end of the food supply chain, present a risk for themselves and their near relatives and friends. Several studies highlighted gaps in food safety knowledge and some critical safety violations regarding food handling at home. Global food safety will be achieved only when every single link in the food supply chain will entirely become master of its particular area and will trust in the activity of both the previous and the following link in the food safety circle called the food supply chain, not ignoring the consumer as the one who should be aware of potential risks, proper handling and preparation of food for safe and balanced everyday meals. Only safety-conscious consumers can become active partners within the food safety circle. In this chapter, a review of consumer studies and their conclusions concerning food safety knowledge and practices will be presented. Also the role and responsibility of consumer as a last link in the food supply chain will be discussed. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: This chapter presents the approach and preliminary findings of a training and research project for linking small-scale farmers to supermarkets in China. The project aims at developing strategies for the supply of fresh fruits and vegetables by small-scale farmers to SPAR supermarkets. Methodology/approach: The project is a joint activity of the Netherlands Agricultural Economics Research Institute (LEI), Wageningen University, the Chinese Institute for Agricultural Economics and Development, SPAR International, and the HuBei Supervision office for Rural Professional Cooperative Organisation. Three complementary research activities have been carried out: a SPAR fresh supply chain analysis, a quantitative study on the governance of fresh produce supply chains, and a quantitative study on the role of cooperatives in these supply chains. For the first activity a Rapid Value Chain Analysis tool was used. For the governance study a survey was carried out among farmers producing fruits and vegetables. For the cooperative study a survey was held among more than 200 agricultural cooperatives. Findings: From the supply chain analysis it has become clear that uniform quality is the main bottleneck in fresh produce supply chains. Another important challenge is the lack of communication between producers and SPAR procurement managers. The results of the governance survey supported the hypothesis that contracts and trust are complementary governance mechanisms. Also the hypothesis that trading parties make more use of contractual governance when environmental uncertainty increases, is supported. Finally, the survey on cooperatives showed that cooperatives are becoming major trading partners in fresh produce supply chains. Newly established cooperatives receive substantial support from the government, including technical advice on quality issues. Practical implications: The results of the research activities have been used for training and support activities such as (a) development of a SPAR strategy for purchasing fresh produce from smallscale farmers and cooperatives; (b) training of supply managers to improve the quality of products delivered by farmers to SPAR; and (c) training of staff of provincial authorities supporting farmers' cooperatives. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

abstract={We develop and test an integrated analytical framework to investigate interactions among guanxi networks, buyer-seller relationships, contractual governance and relationship satisfaction in the Chinese vegetable industry. The survey results show that guanxi networks positively contribute to trusting relationships and substantially enhance business satisfaction. However, farmers' approaches to achieving satisfying relationships with their buyers are different from those employed by vegetable processing and exporting firms. Relational governance substantially reduces transaction costs. Furthermore, the total effects of relational governance (based on guanxi networks) on contractual governance underline the importance of trust-building activities. The complementary effects of guanxi networks on contractual governance imply that a combination of relational and contractual governance in vegetable supply chains may be the best way to improve business relationships and to enhance marketing performance.© CAB International 2010.

abstract={Trust is an integral part of agri-food supply chain operation, both for ensuring food safety and quality, and facilitating the exchange relationships between businesses. Through its implicit sharing of norms and values by transacting parties, it is central to good chain relationships. This chapter explores the nature and role of trust in eight selected agri-food chains in four EU countries. Following a brief consideration of the concept of trust, the empirical analysis identifies key features of the business environments of the selected agri-food chains, and their possible influence on chain relationships. The assessment is based on 28 qualitative interviews with food chain experts. In particular, the connection between perceived trust levels and the prevailing type of vertical business relationships is explored. The findings suggest that trust is more pronounced among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) whose representatives have personal relationships with each other. There is more trust upstream in the chain than downstream. However, there is also considerable mistrust at the farmer end in several of the studied chains. Two particular factors contribute to this situation. First, there may be a lack of chain transparency in relation to farm product quality and related prices. Second, where the general economic situation is difficult, the development of trust may be hampered, because all chain participants seek a share of a diminishing chain margin. Further downstream, where frequently larger enterprises are involved, the levels of trust between chain participants vary more substantially. Finally, if bargaining power is distributed unevenly, trust between chain partners may not fully develop. © CAB International 2010. Agri-food Chain Relationships.},

abstract={This chapter explores the theoretical and practical issues affecting the sustainability of business relationships and therefore the cohesion of an agri-food supply chain. This is important because improved supply chain coordination and cooperation amongst chain participants can improve its efficiency and effectiveness, and therefore, its competitiveness and long-term sustainability. The chapter focuses on the UK barley-to-beer and whisky supply chain, drawing on two complementary analyses. First, a survey-based structural equation model is formulated to determine those factors that affect the sustainability of relationships in the chain. The second analysis consists of an in-depth case study based on an important malting barley-tobeer supply chain in eastern England. The findings point to five factors affecting relationship sustainability: communication quality; compatibility of partners' aims; contractual relationships backed by professional regard and personal bonds; high levels of trust between chain participants and a willingness to resolve problems; and commercial benefit. Communication is found to be focused on creating awareness of customer requirements, facilitating logistical issues, problem resolution, maintaining the required quality of service, as well as the trust and friendship of participants. Relationships are assisted if the aims of the supply chain parties are strongly aligned and if contractual relationships are strengthened by professional regard, personal friendships and trust. Finally, each party has to derive clear benefit from a relationship if businesses are to retain a particular set of supply chain arrangements. Consequently, market power issues, that affect the distribution of rewards amongst the partners, require careful consideration in the maintenance of sustainable chain relationships.© CAB International 2010.

abstract={The concept of relationship sustainability is used to evaluate business relationships in theGerman wheat-to-bread supply chain. Relationships are defined as sustainable when thereturns gained from cooperation over time exceed the costs of their initiation andmaintenance.The survey results reveal that businesses in the chain rate the relationship with theirmain business partner as being of high quality and often long term. Results from additionalinterviews with buyers help us to isolate the effects of economic and behaviouraldimensions on continuation and termination of relationships with suppliers. The economicdimension includes competitive price and quality, and supply continuity. The behaviouraldimension is captured by trust as a proxy. These factors turn out to significantly govern thetermination of long-lasting relationships. A lack of trust means that relationships are notdeveloped or are terminated in the early phases. Furthermore, the results show that theactors in the German wheat-to-bread chain are free to choose the relationship type andlength so as to maximize profit under given environmental conditions. Based on thesefindings we conclude that the analysed chain relationships can be considered as sustainable.© CAB International 2010. Agri-food Chain Relationships.},

abstract={Purpose – This paper aims to develop a hierarchical typology of trust elements for businesstobusiness trade among European companies in the food sector. Design/methodology/approach – The paper integrates desk research literature study and a qualitative survey of food industry companies. An extensive literature review about interorganizational trust lays a foundation for designing a draft typology based on previous studies, with special attention paid to the influence of culture. Finetuning and validation of the typology is achieved through an exploratory field study based on 18 qualitative indepth interviews with key informants in five EU countries, involving practitioners from the fresh fruit and vegetable, grain, meat and olive supply chains. Findings – A detailed typology of trust is developed. Although it is highly specific to the food industry, it is designed to be neutral to culture and sector, thus allowing the identification of differences in culture when dealing with trust building elements in different sectors in the food supply chain. Research limitations/implications – Since the buyer's perspective is adopted in this paper, further research is needed to validate the typology on the seller side. The typology developed here must also be tested in practice, for instance within a descriptive research quantitative study, aimed at quantifying the relative importance of the different trust elements. Practical implications – The typology stimulates the consideration of crosscultural or crosssector differences in the salience of trust attributes and its construction process confirms that reputation management is an extremely important determinant of success or failure. It can serve as a checklist for any company that is interested in improving its relationships with suppliers or buyers. Originality/value – The paper adds to the body of knowledge about interorganizational trust, providing researchers with a useful tool for conducting experimental research on trust creation mechanisms. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Understanding consumer confidence in the safety of food products and the regulation thereof is critical for effective implementation of risk management and communication strategies aimed at restoring consumer trust in food chains. The perceived risk and mistrust of food safety systems influences public concerns. Consumer responses to risk messages contribute to the unacceptability of proposals for activities perceived as risky stimulate social and political action to reduce or avoid risk lead to questioning of the work and decisions of risk regulators and authorities and promote the selective use of information sources. This chapter looks at public attitudes towards food its safety and the risks and uncertainty associated with it. It considers the impact of food traceability and corporate social responsibility in increasing transparency throughout the food chain and enhancing consumer confidence in food and food producers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the most effective and desirable mechanisms for achieving an appropriate level of food safety in the food supply chain. © 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={The seeds of Allanblackia trees produce edible oil with significant global market potential. Consequently, a private-public partnership involving Unilever and known as ‘Novella Africa’ is engaged in the development of Allanblackia as a new crop in a number of African countries. The purpose of this partnership is to build a profitable and sustainable initiative for harvest, marketing and cultivation. Rural communities are directly involved and a participatory approach to domestication is being followed to maximise farmers' livelihood benefits. This is the first time a multinational company has partnered in such an approach, and the initiative represents an example for the domestication of other new tree crops. Investing in good communication between partners is considered to be essential to success by ensuring trust and a common understanding of priorities. Progress to date has involved the establishment of market supply chains for oil, based firstly on wild harvest, and the initiation of cultivation by smallholders. Further work will involve the development of rural resource centres to deliver improved germplasm to growers. At the same time, these centres will provide other services such as market information, credit and access to buyers. Through this strategy it is foreseen that there will be progress towards the development of a market value chain which removes producers' constraints to profitable involvement. Furthermore, the diversification of farmers' cropping systems should have positive impacts for biodiversity and provide resilience in the face of climate change. Currently, the most important activity under the initiative is the promotion of Allanblackia planting, so that production constraints do not hamper market development. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose - Chinese agri-food chains consist of the millions of small scale farmers, who are not well structured and organized in the supply chain. Owing to market liberalization and globalization, one of the most challenging issues along agri-food chains in China is becoming the issue of how to link these small-scale farmers into the modern chains. Consequently, it is essential for both policy makers and private sectors to understand the governance structure in agri-food supply chains. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework for supply chain governance, including its antecedents and consequences, as well as a series of hypotheses for empirical testing. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework of chain governance is proposed in this study, where governance structure consists of two dimensions: contractual governance and relational governance.The study intends to propose a complementary relationship between contracts and relational aspects, such as trust, in the Chinese context. Future research is needed to empirically test this model. Findings - The proposed conceptual model is unique, since the majority of the articles addressing this topic focuses on contract farming while limited research touches upon the issues of trust and relations. However, a combination of both contracting and relationships are seldom addressed. Originality/value - This paper evaluates a novel concept of two dimensional governance structure in the agri-food supply chain, where transaction cost economics theory and relational theory are combined to study the governance relationships between small scale producers in China and their buyers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We developed and applied a model of consumer risk perceptions of beef food safety to better understand the underlying drivers of consumer demand for food safety. We show how consumer demographics, country-of-residence, as well as reliance on, and trust in, alternative food safety information sources affect risk perceptions of consumers in Canada, Japan and the United States. Consumers in all three countries have risk perceptions shaped by their level of reliance on observable and credence attribute information. Risk perceptions of consumers in each country are significantly higher for those less trusting of doctors. Moreover, personal and indirect food safety experiences substantially affect risk perceptions. These results are useful to decision-makers in developing more efficient supply chain management strategies and public policies aimed at building or sustaining consumer confidence in food safety. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={The participatory guarantee systems (PGS) for organic certification do not involve a third party certification body; therefore, the lower certification costs involvedmake it particularly suitable for rural communities in developing countries. Its success is related to the chance of being recognised at a national as well as international level and to its role in promoting the local rural development. The goal of the present study is to explore how social cohesion, trust and market relate one to another along the supply chain and to explain the interaction between participatory organic certification and the development of rural communities. The analytical approach, based on the work of Henry Farrell, considers how the level of formalism among the agents involved in the certification process interacts with the flexibility and scope of the relationship, including the extension of the market area in which the social control can provide guarantees comparable to those a third party certification body can give. We analysed the case of Rede Ecovida, a network of organic and conventional farmers and other stakeholders operating along the production chain, including local NGOs. The data and information collection has been carried out involving an empirical survey analysing the reasons leading to perform organic farming and set up a participatory organic certification, and an evaluation of the participatory organic farming impact on trade relationships. Collected data have been integrated with the results of another survey on the Rede Ecovida. The survey had an exploratory nature since the estimators are biased, coming form an non random and non representative sample. Results showed the positive effect of the participatory approach on the local economic, social and environmental development, and its still very low chances to have access to the export market. An interesting finding regards the role of the farmers network (Rede Ecovida) in promoting trust in the organic products beyond the boundaries of local communities.},

abstract={An investigation into the seed yam supply chain was carried out to identify the components of commercial seed yam supply systems, which affect the supply of clean seed yams by smallholder farmers in Nigeria. Up to 108 respondents were used to generate data for the analysis. Data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to capture the mean ratings across the supply chain, while the Z - statistic was used to test for factors that influence seed yam traders' marketing strategies and extent of performance of marketing functions in the delivery of clean seed yams to farmers. The results of the analysis identified seed yam producers, collector agents (sometimes called yam traders or yam dealers), wholesalers and retailers as the main actors in seed yam supply within and outside the lowland belt of River Niger in Nigeria. The collector agents act as cartel and occupy a central position in the entire supply chain process. They act as intermediaries between farmers and wholesalers especially where farmer groups do not exist and provide a major distribution network or market linkage for the marketing of the seed yams. The study identified pests attack and disease infestation (24.0%), physical injury on the seed yams (65.1%), poor knowledge of seed multiplication techniques (39.4%) short shelf life of the tubers (33.2%), activities of cartels, deplorable road and poor proximity to market (45.5%) as the factors that affect consumer preference and efficient delivery network in the seed yam supply chain. The research also identified poor business practices including sharp practices, lack of trust and confidence amongst major actors (wholesalers and retailers), insufficient working capital (76.3%), amongst others as the factors militating against efficient seed yam supply chain. © 2009 Academic Journals.},

abstract={This study attempts to empirically investigate how the concepts of relationship marketing affect market performance in Chinese vegetable sector. We interviewed 167 vegetable farmers and 84 processing and exporting companies to test our conceptual relationship model. Results demonstrate that personal relationships (called guanxi in China) significantly improve interpersonal trust and transaction-specific investments, which eventually show a significant impact on market performance. Results imply that the impact of guanxi networks differ on farmers and on companies. The study also reveals that transaction-related attributes (such as risk, channel requirements, and transaction conditions) influence trust, investment behavior, and market performance together with guanxi networks. The article ends with several managerial implications regarding the development of relationship marketing in China.},

abstract={Supply chain related problems are a major impediment to doing business with China, especially where perishable products are concerned. Previous research attributes much of the blame to unsophisticated Chinese logistics and distribution systems, or difficulties in implementing supply chain management (SCM) practices as defined by western literature. One suggestion is that Chinese firms have not yet realized the benefits of SCM, or are not yet at a stage where they can implement them. By comparison, in western countries SCM principles and practices are better understood, in particular the need for strong relationships among supply chain members. Thus as trade with China opens up under WTO agreements, it will become more important to understand the differences in how relationships with others in the supply chain are managed between Chinese and western firms. This research compared the management of business relationships among firms in supply chains between China and Australia. Data were gathered from detailed surveys of 84 food firms in China and 22 Australian food exporters. Most were involved in trade in horticultural produce. Results indicate that both Chinese and Australian firms clearly understand the benefits that can flow from good SCM practices. However Chinese firms essentially act in the belief that their key suppliers and customers are not honest, while Australian firms assume the opposite. As a result, Chinese firms show less trust and commitment to their key suppliers and key customers than Australian firms do. Australian firms therefore have a limited range of chain- building strategies open to them and should adopt a conservative approach. These lessons could apply equally well to horticultural exporters in any western country wishing to establish supply chains with Chinese importers.},

abstract={Substantial changes in the market for nursery products in Germany have transformed the way that supply chain partners perform transactions and interact with each other. This paper focuses on the interaction between producers and retailers of nursery products. Three case studies investigating three distinct retailer types, an owner managed garden centre, a chain store garden centre and a Do-It- Yourself store company, are analysed utilising transaction cost theory. Thereby, the structure and communication of the supply chain interfaces are analysed for all three retail types and determining factors for the kind of transaction relationship are deduced. Finally, recommendations are drawn regarding how to improve the transaction relationship between producers and retailers of nursery products. The degree of trust, information sharing and the usage of information sharing systems are found to be key points for future improvement.},

abstract={Consumer concern about treats associated with food is growing. Due to recent food crises in Europe, food quality and food safety have become a hot topic in mass media. "Food safety" is a broader term, which means an assurance that food will not cause harm to the consumer when it is prepared and/or eaten according to its intended use. Today we master food safety with different good practices which are the consequence of human culture, history and lifestyle. If we analyse good practices in the broad spectre of food area we could arrange them in three categories. First category of good practices is directly connected with food technology (i.e., Good Manufacturing Practice - GMP). Second category is indirectly connected with food issues (i.e., Good Research Practice - GRP, Good Educational Practice - GEP, Good Training Practice - GTrP). Third category deals with all the activities regarding consumers' food handling (Good Housekeeping Practice - GHKP). Consumers are not connected to food supply chain according to chain principles. Consumer behaviour and attitudes toward food safety have shown that the levels of understanding, motivation and trust need to be further cultivated. It has been shown that present maintenance of food safety in food supply chain can be easily broken down, because of different kind of barriers or simple misunderstanding. Therefore a new approach called "Good Nutritional Practice" (GNP) was coined to manage food safety. It is important to reconstruct the existent food safety system with GNP which includes consumers, and is based on a model that covers subsystems from other good practices. Food safety point of view should be focused on knowledge, constant education and exchange of information. "From Farm to Table" approach is a philosophy with an important goal: safe and healthy food for all consumers. With this aspect in mind, we are building foundation for Good Life Practice. © 2007.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the attitudes and experiences of Scottish farmers in marketing their beef and sheep, and the nature of their marketing relationships. As such, it seeks to identify the challenges that the recently revised Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture may face with respect to the wider establishment of collaborative supply chains and the strengthening of links between beef and sheep farmers and other parts of the meat supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - The approach involved a postal survey of beef and sheep producers throughout Scotland, with a sample which was representative in terms of regional and farm size distribution. In total 1,778 questionnaires were mailed, with a response rate of 34 per cent (n=611). In addition, interviews were held with major meat processors and retailers in order to provide a "reality check" for the information from the survey. Findings - The results from the survey show that there are low levels of customer awareness amongst farmers in the red meat chain, and low levels of trust of other chain participants, particularly in relation to price. Originality/value - The wisdom of developing collaborative supply chains is widely acknowledged throughout the European Union (EU), but such moves need an understanding of the attitudes and circumstances of the various supply chain participants. This paper is of value to practitioners (government, consultants and academia) as it highlights empirical issues that may hamper the development of collaborative supply chains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Service contracts have emerged as an important instrument to secure a long-term relationship between carriers in the container shipping industry and shippers requiring scheduled services covering a global market. This contract, entered into largely on an individual and confidential basis, continues to enjoy anti-trust immunity under current United States and European Union regulations. It will continue to be in place even after the EC Council Regulation 4056/86 is repealed in October 2008 although it may operate in a modified way because of the absence of the common external conference tariff. This article examines the implications of this instrument on the international supply chain and explores its future role in defining efficiencies in international trade flows. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper reviews the opportunities available for food businesses to encourage consumers to eat healthier and more nutritious diets, to invest in more sustainable manufacturing and distribution systems and to develop procurement systems based on more sustainable forms of agriculture. The important factors in developing more sustainable supply chains are identified as the type of supply chain involved and the individual business attitude to extending responsibility for product quality into social and environmental performance within their own supply chains. Interpersonal trust and working to standards are both important to build more sustainable local and many conserved food supply chains, but inadequate to transform mainstream agriculture and raw material supplies to the manufactured and commodity food markets. Cooperation among food manufacturers, retailers, NGOs, governmental and farmers' organizations is vital in order to raise standards for some supply chains and to enable farmers to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Achieving supply chain management among firms in the Indonesian mango industry is a worthwhile goal, for such will provide opportunities for supply chains to better respond to the dynamics of international and domestic markets. This paper discusses supply chain formation for the purpose of addressing the question "how can the mango industry improve supply chain management?" We propose that this question is best addressed by changing the state of the system from segmented supply chains to more integrated supply chains. Complexity theories have portrayed the supply chain as a complex adaptive system whose behaviour is influenced by self organizing mechanisms. On the other hand, governments sometimes intervene in an attempt to create improved supply chains. This paper addresses government intervention whose predetermined goal is supply chain formation by examining two case studies in West Java and East Java, Indonesia. In West Java, the intervention failed to meet its goals and broke down as it could not build trust-based relationships. In East Java, intervention initially failed, but supported by lessons drawn from the West Java case, it is now showing signs of flexibility, agility and robustness, which are features of positive self organising systems. In this case, it is possible that improved supply chain management may be achieved. Based on theory, combined with learning from these two cases, a framework is developed that integrates complex adaptive system characteristics and supply chain management outcomes.},

abstract={Horticultural supply chains are changing rapidly. Transactions are increasingly based on chains that involve coordinated links between farmers, traders, processors and retailers. It is against this background that donors, NGOs and government extension services ("linking organizations") are seeking to enhance the performance of supply chains, using the "linking farmers to markets" approach. This paper examines experiences in linking farmers to horticultural markets to reach some tentative conclusions regarding success factors. It considers examples of linkages promoted both by the private sector on its own and by linking organizations and then reviews in detail the linkage activities of the latter. Emphasis is placed on markets identified for linkages, on the capacity of the linking organizations, on the dangers inherent in subsidizing farmers and on the relationship between the private sector, linking organizations and farmers. As mutual trust between all actors in a supply chain is essential, this paper discusses how trust can be developed. Linking farmers to new institutional markets invariably requires farmers to be organized into formal or informal groups. Experiences with group organization are reviewed, as is the question of finance. Problems faced by farmers in maintaining linkages are examined and sustainability and scaling-up of horticultural linkage activities are considered. Broader issues also emerge. Working with farmers will have little impact if the enabling environment that governments provide is inappropriate for horticultural supply chain development. An unanswered question is whether linking organizations are actually increasing the size of the market or whether they are just replacing one group of farmer suppliers with a new set of "target beneficiaries". Finally, it needs to be asked whether limited resources would be better channelled towards activities likely to benefit a larger number of farmers.},

abstract={The aim of the current paper is to focus on the processes that rule transactions among firms, trying to highlight coordination forms. In stable social networks exchange occurs because of certain social elements, such as trust and reputation, which have a good influence on clarifying the expectations of the parties involved and on audit cost reductions. In this case social capital represents the coordination form that enables such relationships. To prove this statement we analyzed the network of socio-economic relationships in the organic olive oil supply chain in the Sierra de Segura (Andalusia).},

abstract={This paper highlights the urgent need for a shift in strategic thinking and the development of new strategies to increase demand and the flow of horticultural produce through global supply chains. Over supply, increasing competition, low farm-gate prices and the increasing emphasis on food safety, quality assurance and environmental management systems to gain market access, are key issues facing the 1,200 million smallholder farmers in Asia. New technologies, even if they are low-input and adapted to Asian conditions, are often too expensive for the small farmers to implement. However, if they are implemented, they can lead to 5-10 fold increases in household income. Governments and international aid programs need to educate farmers so that they can selectively target growing markets and provide them with the start-up capital to implement new technologies, which subsequently lead them to become less dependent on income support mechanisms. To be globally competitive, farmers need to market collectively, preferably through their own companies or through cooperatives. These collaborative marketing groups must be of sufficient size and scale, perhaps inclusive of several thousand farmers, to be able to achieve economies of scale in purchasing and logistics and to command significant power in the supermarket-dominated supply chain. To achieve this, new extension specialists with skills in facilitation will be needed to build trust between the shareholders of such enterprises. At the consumer end, a new approach is needed to combat static or declining consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. One such approach is education of children and health professionals on the health and medicinal benefits of eating fresh fruit and vegetables. Significantly greater fruit and vegetable consumption will subsequently drive increasing throughput through global supply chains and thus greatly benefit farmers in the developing countries.},

abstract={The fast development of market outlets (e.g., supermarkets, processing industries, international markets) in China provides rich opportunities for small-scale farmers to upgrade quality and increase income. However, the high level of transaction costs incurred in small-volume-based vegetable transactions hinders farmers from participating in these emerging markets. This article explores how personal relationships (called guanxi in China) and trust between farmers and their buyers influence transaction costs in vegetable transactions, and thereby also farmers' participation in emerging markets. We interviewed 167 vegetable farmers in Jiangsu Province, which provided data for empirical testing using two-stage probit analysis with endogenous variables. The findings suggest that guanxi and trust effectively reduce transaction costs in vegetable marketing in China, which may help and encourage farmers to better participate in emerging markets. The results also reveal that farmers' age, education, marketing experience, distance to the market, production scale and land quality influence transaction costs. The article ends with policy implications with respect to efficiently reducing transaction costs in vegetable supply chains in order to create a better environment for small-scale farmers in emerging markets in China.},

abstract={The main objective of this study was to generate policy lessons and working methods to guide public policy makers and private actors in supporting the greater inclusion of small-scale producers in dynamic markets. The study shows that a transparent margin system is a form of co-innovation which has created dynamic changes at the producer level and provided small farmers with access to modern supply chains. Factors that support small farmers' inclusion are the farmers' ability, willingness and trust. Farmers received the highest benefit from the transparent margin system. Sustainability of the transparent margin system is dependent on commitment, the trust of those involved in the partnership, transformation of marketing institutions, the innovation learning process, risk management and the role of rural production organizations in the marketing system. The partnership can be replicated by providing incentives and support to the supply chain champion.},

abstract={This chapter provides a comprehensive theoretical framework that focuses on the linkages between four key dimensions of supply chain organisation of perishable tropical food products. These dimensions are channel choice, governance regime, quality performance and value added distribution. The first two represent the structure of the supply chain, whereas the last two dimensions focus on supply chain performance. Channel choice deals with how to reach the final customer in the most optimal way. Governance regime reflects how to reduce transaction costs and enhance cooperation and trust amongst supply chain partners. Quality performance deals with how to manage food technology processes such that quality levels can be enhanced and variability in quality can be exploited. Finally, value added distribution treats the way in which an acceptable remuneration can be guaranteed to all supply chain partners according to their contributions and efforts. Main attention is given to the impact of different governance regimes and management practices for the establishment of appropriate incentive structures that enable supply chain partners to invest in resources and devote concerted efforts to quality improvement. Reduction of transaction costs, creation of networks based on trust (social capital) and tradeoffs between direct and future gains might offer substantial contributions to effective quality management and enforcement. Transparency in contract specifications or bargaining procedures may contribute to a better distribution of the value added resulting from improved quality performance. © Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands, 2007.

abstract={The industrialization of agriculture and the potential problem of small-scale farmer marginalization calls for a fresh approach to the design of agribusiness supply chain arrangements in developing countries. The objective of the paper is to contribute to a better understanding of institutional arrangements that can promote stable smallholder agribusiness contracting arrangements in a developing country context. A case study approach, incorporating a transaction cost framework, is used to test whether trust can significantly change the contract characteristics of supply. The results suggest that although the presence of trust can influence the contract characteristics of a supply arrangement, it may not be significant because of other factors in a developing country context. Bearing this in mind, a number of institutional arrangements are recommended in order to promote more stable contract conditions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper reports on a relationship between the University of Toronto and a non-profit, non-governmental ("third party") certifying organization called Local Flavour Plus (LFP). The University as of August 2006 requires its corporate caterers to use local and sustainable farm products for a small but increasing portion of meals for most of its 60,000 students. LFP is the certifying body, whose officers and consultants have strong relations of trust with sustainable farmers. It redefines standards and verification to create ladders for farmers, Aramark and Chartwells (the corporations that won the bid), and the University, to continuously raise standards of sustainability. After years of frustrated efforts, other Ontario institutions are expressing interest, opening the possibility that a virtuous circle could lead to rapid growth in local, sustainable supply chains. The paper examines the specificities of the LFP approach and of the Toronto and Canadian context. Individuals in LFP acquired crucial skills, insights, experience, resources, and relationships of trust over 20 years within the Toronto "community of food practice," located in a supportive municipal, NGO and social movement context. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.},

funding_text 1={Schreiner and Stahlbrand met at the Toronto Food Policy Council, on the day in early 2005 when Coordinator Roberts invited both to address the Council. Each had turned to the Council for help in scaling up markets in sustainable agriculture in Ontario, but from different sectors – private business and NGO. Schreiner was ready to move on from the organic distribution business, as he turned over management to a new partner. His business had started with a grant from the City of Toronto administered by the TFPC, which allowed him to buy a refrigerated truck, and with low cost warehouse space at FoodShare. Stahlbrand was looking for support for an Ontario ecola-bel, at the time envisioned as Food Alliance Canada, which grew out of her work with WWF Canada. She had already begun to work under FoodShare’s welcoming umbrella, which allowed her to apply for grants under their charitable status. These small grants kept her going for a few months at a time. Both Schreiner and Stahlbrand had worked independently for years to arrive at convergent understandings. The embracing community of practice, via TFPC, allowed them to collaborate quickly.},

abstract={This study examines the nature of the relationship between cane growers and millers and how it affects cane growers' perceptions of the value added in the sugar supply chain. Drawing from relational exchange theory, the study utilised the perceptions of 124 smallholder cane growers in the Swaziland sugar industry. Factors measured in terms of a likert type scale were used to measure each relational construct within the miller-grower contract relationship. The unpacks the trust relationship between large agribusiness companies and smallholder out growers, and shows that relationships characterised by social factors like trust, commitment, and cooperation enhance mutual benefit and quality relationships between parties. This study found that farmers perceive an element of opportunistic behaviour and a lack of cooperation by millers and therefore have limited trust in the millers. Consequently it was also found that satisfaction by cane growers on their relationship with millers has a positive relationship with their level of trust, level of commitment, relative dependence, perception of opportunistic behaviour by millers and perceived cooperation between themselves and the millers.

abstract={Many food traits desired by consumers are costly to provide and difficult to verify. A complicating factor is that delivered quality can only be affected stochastically by producers and imperfectly observed by consumers. Markets for these goods will emerge only if supplying firms can be trusted. We develop a repeated purchases model to explore how quality discoverability, market structure, nature of reputations, market premiums, and discount factors drive firm choice about the stringency of quality assurance systems designed to gain consumer trust. Reputation protection is key incentive for firms to invest in high-quality goods and quality assurance systems. © 2007 American Agricultural Economics Association.},

abstract={The raison d'être of the global food industry is to satisfy the increasingly evolving requirements of global consumers. Consumer mega-trends include: demographic changes; concerns about safety, health, well-being and nutrition; and an inexorable search for convenience, particularly in urban markets. Across the globe, starting in developed and migrating to emerging countries, the growth of supermarket retailing is a principal link between the food industry and its consumers. A relatively few, sophisticated international retailers are establishing businesses in both geographic hemispheres and, in doing so, are transforming the nature and operations of international supply chains. The implications of international horticultural supply chains being transformed from "supply push" to "demand pull" are profound for all stakeholders, including farmers, exporters and importers, and the international R&D community. Commodity markets are fragmenting into specific consumer segments. The R&D focus is shifting from input traits (e.g. yield, disease resistance) to consumerled output traits (e.g. taste, size, shape), and is becoming an increasingly private sector function. The challenge is to identify and commercialize product attributes that consumers value and will pay a premium. Those businesses capturing the intellectual property associated with value-added products will take the lion's share of the consumer's dollar. The trend towards "privatization" of R&D will cause current supply chains which are open and commodity orientated to become closed, with exclusive providers of genetics linking with specific producers, exporters, importers and retailers. The horticultural industry will come under increasing price pressure in the future, as fewer, larger businesses control access to the higher income consumers. However, competition will evolve from solely price-based competition to innovationbased competition (comprising innovation in products, processes, and in services). Successful horticultural businesses around the world will seek to build trust and longer-term commercial relationships with those who have "the ear" of the consumer, bringing in an era of interdependence, rather than independence.},

abstract={The criteria for accepting or rejecting a technology extend beyond the intrinsic properties of the finished product such as physical performance. There are also extrinsic factors such as the history of the product and trust in the manufacturers and suppliers, as well as the perceptions and risk management strategies of various stakeholder groups. A methodology was trialled to take into account the extended supply chain of the product, while simultaneously engaging stakeholders to determine and to understand their perceptual frameworks. Three pine decking products manufactured using different amounts and types of chemical modification were compared using life cycle assessment and the comments of 114 respondents from six stakeholder groups in New Zealand. The results of the perceptual research include a quadrant diagram which allows a visual comparison of the responses of different stakeholders to actual or hypothetical products, aiding the identification of when and why certain technologies may be disqualified from acceptability or become the topic of public debate.},

abstract={The 48 members of the Ezemvelo Farmers' Organisation (EFO) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (SA), that are fully-certified as organic farmers were surveyed in October-December 2004 to assess their perceived levels of satisfaction, trust, cooperation and commitment in a formal supply chain producing amadhumbes (a traditional vegetable tuber), potatoes and sweet potatoes for a major SA supermarket group. Empirical recursive models show that a high level of satisfaction in the working relationship results in these farmers trusting the pack-house agent more. High levels of trust, in turn, lead to higher levels of both commitment to, and cooperation in, the supply chain. A simultaneous-equation model showed that EFO members with higher levels of commitment tend to be more cooperative, and that members with higher levels of cooperation tend to be more committed toward the working relationship. These results suggest that strategies to improve the working relationship with the pack-house agent need to promote satisfaction, trust, cooperation and commitment. For example, co-investment in better crop storage facilities at farm-level would promote satisfaction and hence trust. There is also scope for more cooperation in the planning of new organic crop products to grow and market, and to remove some price uncertainty by giving EFO farmers more information about prices that they will be paid by the packhouse in this supply chain.},

abstract={Over the past decade, the UK fresh produce (fruit, vegetables, and salads) supply chain has undergone numerous changes, with retailers becoming increasingly powerful. The overall trend is towards the industry being dominated by a few large corporations operating on a national level, with some corporations even operating on a European or global scale. This process, which could significantly impact on the supplier-retailer relationships, is examined in this study using in-depth interviews with participants from the fresh produce supply chain. Amongst the findings are the following: Supply chain advancements, including backhauling, and factory gate pricing are causing some controversy because suppliers feel that these initiatives do not benefit their relationships with retailers. There is room for supplier-retailer relationship improvement in areas such as trust, co-operation, and collaboration. Retailers, who have significant supply chain power, are starting to acknowledge the importance of suppliers in the gaining of gaining retail market share. Lastly, the intense process of supply-chain rationalisation that we have seen in recent years appears to be leveling out in the UK fresh produce supply, such that there is less anticipated further rationalisation. The study outlines a series of recommendations for how suppliers (retailers) can improve their relationships with retailers (suppliers). © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose - Public concerns with issues including animal welfare and environmental management and stewardship have required organisations within the food supply chain to formally demonstrate their commitment to ethical issues. This has led to the development of corporate social responsibility strategies and the use of ethical risk assessment models. The purpose of the study is to review both qualitative and quantitative methods of assessment. Design/methodology/approach - This paper begins with a discussion on ethical issues. This is followed by an evaluation of current mechanisms for determining both scientific- and value-based approaches to ethical food policy. Findings - Legislation defines governmental policy but it does not define what is "good" or "right" and this is the role of ethics. In order to have ethic reasoning embedded in food policy either at governmental or at organisational level, policy makers must be able to understand and evaluate moral arguments, be fair-minded and make well-reasoned decisions. Consumers need to trust that both policy makers and those manufacturing and supplying food make decisions and provide information which is accessible, accurate and affords reasoned choice when purchasing food products. Originality/value - This paper provides a review of ethical methodology and mechanisms for assisting in ethical decision making and will be of interest to academics and to industry. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={It is widely accepted that trust is the critical determinant of a good buyer-seller relationship. Using trust as the dependent variable, various measures of the farmers' satisfaction with the exchange, power-dependence and the relationship specific investments preferred trading partners provided to facilitate the relationship were regressed against trust. The key antecedent to trust was the willingness of the preferred trading partner to advise the farmer of supply problems. Farmers preferred to transact with cooperative trading partners who refrained from using coercive power to achieve their own objectives. Once trust had been established, farmers perceived that transacting with preferred trading partners was significantly less risky. Preferred trading partners were perceived to have a good reputation, to make the best offer, to treat the farmers fairly and equitably and to offer the best service. The farmers' desire to transact with local traders and those traders with whom they had developed a close personal friendship were considered to be not only antecedent to trust but also to reinforce trust in the relationship.},

abstract={This study discusses how a religious based voluntary group in Taiwan called Tse-Xin was able to harness elements of social capital to successfully implement organic production and accreditation systems for rice, fresh produce and processed foods in Taiwan. Social capital refers to the inherent structure of relations between social actors. Societies differ in their stocks of social capital, or resources embedded in their social relations. Social capital can be actual resources or remain potential resources depending on the context and how they are harnessed. In this case study, various extension programs were carried out voluntarily by Tse-Xin group members to influence existing growers attitudes and actions in the production of organic foods. Furthermore, growers and potential growers and processors who already embrace positive attitudes towards safe foods were encouraged to venture into new businesses through the retail network established by the group. The organisation's success factors included vision from leadership, trust among group members, teamwork and having their own distribution channels, resulting in abundant resources to popularise organic production and certification. It is proposed that many of the success factors have roots in Taiwanese social capital and are further enhanced by the leadership of the organisation. Elements of social capital include respect for authority, homogeneity of ideas, trust, benevolence and collectivism. The gains of such a system include improvement in returns to growers, heightened awareness of the organic alternative among consumers and environmental sustainability. Much of the discussion in this case study may be of interest to developing countries that also possess similar social capital.},

abstract={Urbanisation and changing patterns of consumer demand are providing cassava and sweetpotato farmers with new opportunities for raising their incomes. However, these farmers, especially those located in remote areas, face many challenges in realising these opportunities. The paper presents six cases where interventions by R&D institutions have supported - or are currently supporting - farmers in establishing or strengthening their links with growth markets. From these experiences, the following lessons have been learned: a) success depends on there being a well-identified demand for the product, b) a facilitator is required to help initiate contacts and build trust among production to consumption chain actors, c) the identification of a chain champion, usually from the private sector, who has vision and drive, is crucial for the longer term sustainability of relationships, d) traders and processors are key actors whose organisation and support are as important as the organisation of farmers, e) rural agro-enterprises require effective financial and non-financial support services for them to grow, and f) an enterprise's capacity to innovate is critical for maintaining competitiveness and adapting to changing market conditions. Most R&D institutions need to strengthen their competence and capacity to facilitate and support smallholder farmers in the identification of appropriate market opportunities and in establishing relationships with the most important supply chain actors and service providers that can help their enterprises grow.},

abstract={Purpose - Food safety is an important issue facing consumers, the food industry and the government. Since consumers cannot themselves easily assess food safety risks, their perception of food safety is, in part, a matter of trust in the food chain. This study seeks to focus on livestock farmers and to investigate the causal relationship between the factors that determine consumer trust, regarding food safety and in turn their purchase likelihood. Design/methodology/approach - By integrating theories developed in several disciplines, six factors, namely: providing information, competence, integrity, benevolence, credibility, and reliability were adopted for this study. The conceptual model was tested with a sample of 194 individuals in the form of a structural equation model using LISREL 8.30. Findings - The research confirms that livestock farmers could draw benefit from strategies to increase their trustworthiness through provision of information, show their benevolence and integrity to consumers, and in turn positively influence consumers' purchasing decision. Practical implications - Livestock farmers should understand more specifically what consumers want to know and provide accurate and reliable information. Originality/value - This exploratory study provides a useful insight into the potential benefit from trust building that could be derived by livestock farmers, food safety regulators and the food supply chain as a whole, as well as the ways in which this might be achieved. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The credibility and guarantee attached to the certification process theoretically results from the control company's independence and expertise. In the case of information on the GMO or non GMO nature of the food and agricultural products, these conditions are insufficient for lack of a stabilized definition of the control methods. However, professionals in the supply chain often turn to certification companies in order to ensure greater reliability for their exchanges concerning this information. Our paper analyses the way certification works in these situations. Certification companies are shown to use knowledge and agreements constructed by the actors concerned; they work on formalizing the good intentions of the certified industrialists and finally offer a guarantee on industrial practices based on their own reputation. Rather than supplying a definitive and universal conclusion to the controversy about proofs of GMO "absence", certification companies provide a local compromise between the demands for proof from the customer companies and the investments consented by the suppliers. Resorting to certification then constitutes sufficient proof for the industrialists, a sort of conventional agreement. Certification is a private regulating mechanism which is considered sufficient, at least locally and temporarily, not to continuously endanger the necessary coordination for market exchanges: in any case it is considered more satisfactory than the one-sided intervention of public authorities. © NSS-Dialogues, EDP Sciences 2004.},

abstract={Following milk and dairy products fruit and vegetables are the most important product categories of organic food sales in Germany. While most market segments for organic products are saturated there is an Europe-wide undersupply of organic fruit and vegetables. At the same time more then 30% of the crops go bad on their way from the farms to the consumer. Among other things this can be attributed to uncoordinated and to less product-specific handling by participants of the supply chain. In this research, typical chains of organically produced vegetables in Germany, in Switzerland and in the Netherlands were investigated. Here, qualitative interviews with actors and experts were carried out to look at the various activities of quality safeguarding in the respective chains and countries. The different meanings of quality by the actors, insufficient technical resources, badly co-ordinated working processes and low consumer demand for organic products were identified as weaknesses of the systems in place. Many of the success factors for improving quality, such as a common goal and control of the participants, intensive communication, exchange of knowledge and information and an informal leader of the chain are also characteristic for network structures in general. Furthermore, efforts to boost consumer demand are considered to be important. In Switzerland, success of the system in place is based both on a clear position of the food retailing sector as an informal leader and on structures that encourage trust and ensure a stable balance of power between actors. In the Netherlands, in turn, the traditionally professional production and the general preference for personal contacts and dialogue were identified as the specific advantages of the existing structures.},

abstract={Previous research identified the strategic drivers in the New Zealand fresh produce industry as supply, supermarket buying power, bananas and distribution. Underlying conditions that act as enablers for successful produce industry supply relationships are strategic fit, trust, economies of scale and level of integration. A subsequent category specific research project that focused on summerfruit yielded not only summerfruit specific information, but also data that, when analysed within the framework generated by the previous research, provided new insights into the relationship between identified individual strategic drivers as well as the relationship between the grouped drivers and the underlying conditions. Produce supply to supermarkets is a permanent balancing act between produce category specific requirements such as ripeness at harvest, post-harvest handling and storage and the reality at point-of-sale, which has retailers offering the entire range of fruit and vegetables for sale, inevitably within a compromise-governed environment. This article examines these issues and the way they present themselves in New Zealand.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of trust in the performance of the sugar industry supply chain in Swaziland. The study utilized perceptions of 124 smallholder cane growers in the sugar industry in Swaziland. Items presented in a Likert type scale were used to measure cane growers' trust in the millers. Descriptive statistics involving cross tabulation were used to determine the impact of trust on the performance of the cane growers, which in turn has an influence on the performance of the whole sugar chain. The results indicate that farmers who have trust in the millers perform better than those without trust, and hence they contribute to the performance of the whole chain, in terms of more and good quality sugarcane supplied to the mill. This implies more sugar production and increased income to the industry as a whole. The results imply that a relationship founded on trust and mutual respect is more likely to succeed than a relationship of convenience supported by legal contingencies. Therefore, there is a need for honesty, fairness and absence of opportunistic behaviour between millers and cane growers for the industry to improve its performance.},

abstract={This paper proposes and analyses a model of relationships between smallholder sugarcane growers and millers in the Swaziland sugar industry supply chain. In particular, it identifies the behavioural factors that contribute to the level of satisfaction that sugarcane growers perceive in their relationship with the millers. Using recursive models and multiple regression analysis, the results indicate that higher levels of trust lead to higher levels of cooperation that, in turn, lead to higher levels of commitment by the smallholder growers to the business relationship. Cooperation is also an antecedent of the benefits and of the satisfaction that these growers gained from the relationship. These results agree with a priori theory that trust, cooperation, strategic benefits, commitment and absence of opportunistic behaviour are essential elements for a successful relational exchange. The findings imply that both cane growers and millers need to focus on initiating, signalling and disclosing their behaviours in an effort to improve their relationship with each other. A relationship founded on trust and mutual respect is more likely to succeed than a relationship of convenience supported by legal contingencies. Therefore, relationships characterised by trust and physical and psychological commitment as well as cooperation between exchange parties is more important for mutual benefit and good quality relationship.},

abstract={Although it is often suggested that trust is an important construct in relationship marketing, there is only little empirical evidence of how, if at all, trust may be used as a valuable strategic variable. In the 1990s, the international food industry faced a number of serious challenges, most notoriously the mad cow disease. The present multiple case study, which is qualitative in nature, explores how the Danish-British bacon supply chain has dealt with the challenges by means of implementing different types of trust. The study confirms that there are different types of trust that marketers can embrace and shows that when one type of trust is not available marketers can draw on other types. The case study also maps different patterns of implementing trust-based marketing approaches. © 2003, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={The world's population is projected at 9 billion by the year 2030. Most of the increase in population will be in developing countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, where chronic food shortages and malnutrition persist. Horticulture is underdeveloped in most African countries. The regions food priorities can be addressed by focusing attention on important horticultural crops and critical issues. Key issues include, food shortage, distribution, nutrition, competitive advantage of individual countries or regions, local and export marketing constraints, and industry strategic planning involving policy, institutional and technological innovations. This paper highlights the great potential of horticultural crops in alleviating food shortage and malnutrition in Africa, constraints, and the need to include nutrition education on agricultural research agendas. To compete in the export markets African countries need to produce horticultural crops or processed products that meet the export market standards, including specifications in importing countries, timely delivery, ample steady supply, grading, packaging, contracts or agreements to build trust, and good quality of product at arrival in the export market. The export marketing constraints and challenges, including poor communication system, lack of market infrastructure, agro-processing plants, marketing credit, proper market organization, proper pricing, uniform grading and standardization of weights and measures; inadequate and poor dissemination of market information, poor post harvest handling and low productivity. Opportunities for the horticultural industry in Africa, such as the development of indigenous vegetables, and orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes, and the use of plant biotechnology, are also discussed. © ISHS.},

abstract={Independent retailers and their primary wholesalers remain a vital part of the U.S. grocery industry, though their future is threatened by the growth of self-distributing chains. These channel partners will have to leverage their collective supply chain to insure survival. This paper presents results from a nationwide survey of independent retailers about this supply chain, exploring two related topics. First, the marketing channel climate between independent retailers and wholesalers is investigated, focusing on the critical relational variables of trust, satisfaction and commitment. Second, the effectiveness of retailer support services provided by wholesalers is examined. The linkage between these two areas is developed and the implications are discussed. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Increased incidents of food poisoning in recent years have greatly shaken consumers’ confidence in food. Livestock farmers are among the least trusted parties in the food supply chain. Building trust between consumers and livestock farmers is critical in order to maintain benefit to both parties. In this context, this paper attempts to explore the process on how trust is developed. By adopting stepwise multiple regression, a conceptual model was tested with 182 respondents. Empirical results showed that trustful information, care for consumers, honesty and fairness to consumers are important to building trust during the period of food safety concerns. Suggestions for future research together with implications for livestock farmers are given. © 2002, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={The managers of agribusiness supply chains in South Africa face three key challenges beyond 2000 - namely the need to manage the drivers of change, to build core competencies to form and manage supply chains, ami to overcome barriers to successful supply chain management. Appropriate actions to meet these challenges include having shared vision and compatible goals, flexible market response, cost controls, effective logistics and risk management, information sharing and, critically, building trust and incentives so that players will invest resources in supply chains. Creative solutions are also needed to handle the potential impacts of HIV/AIDS on market growth and business costs, and to viably integrate communities that were previously denied access to economic opportunities into existing and neiv supply chains. These issues are likely to create business opportunities for firms that are competent coordinators and customizes. Learning from the best practices used by non-agribusiness firms in South Africa and other countries to successfully perform supply chain activities will also improve cost competitiveness.},

abstract={In the absence of a certified seed system, potato farmers in Asia must purchase replacement seed tubers from an informal seed system. With no third party assurance that the seed tubers purchased are of good quality, the farmer's decision to purchase seed may be influenced by the long-standing relationships that have been established between buyers and sellers. Trust is the critical determinant of a good buyer-seller relationship. Through maintaining communication and the making of various relationship specific investments, a conceptual model is proposed which suggests that seed suppliers may engage in trust building behavior which should result in the preferred seed supplier enjoying a greater share of the farmer's patronage. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Links between economic agents known as food manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers are complex, ill understood, changing rapidly, and decreasing in number. This paper focuses on the economics and the reality of a market for a business-to-business, e-commerce system; a system that will capture economies of scale and lower costs of food distribution toward the retail end of the food supply chain. Business-to-business e-commerce is a new way of doing business. It tends to follow a "reverse product cycle" where process efficiency gains come first, followed by quality improvements to existing products and services, and finally the creation of new services and products appear (OECD). The e-commerce marketplace is one where strategy, expectations about others actions, and trust determine demand. For purposes of this paper, the buyers-users in this e-commerce market are retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers who buy and sell products to and from each other. The seller is a service provider who can produce a reliable electronic logistics network that will improve communications and will speed up product flow. Using information technology in this way tends to build vertical alliances. It differs from a market discovery e-commerce (shopping sites) in that it involves an intimate relationship among market agents that lasts for more than one transaction and frequently covers several products, over multiple time periods.},

abstract={Actor network theory and supply chain management theory provide suggestive research directions for understanding regional agri-food networks. These theories claim that relationships based upon trust and cooperation are critical to the strength and vitality of the network. This means that exploring and detailing these relationships among the suppliers, producers, workers, processors, brokers, wholesalers, and retailers within specific regional geographies of these networks are critical for furthering cooperation and trust. Key areas of cooperation include resource sharing and apprenticeship programs. Employing food networks as a key unit of contextual analysis will deepen our understanding of how to enhance their resiliency and vibrancy. Important questions can be raised about the difference gender makes for farmers, brokers, entrepreneurs, and workers in local food networks. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

However, in order to be successful, these alliances have to be trust- based, where trust refers to institution-based, characteristic-based and process-based relationships. In this paper, as case study of a strategic relationship between an industrial conglomerate and a group of resource-poor irrigation farmers in South Africa is described in order to explore the nature of these various trust-based relationships.},
